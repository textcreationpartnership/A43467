            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Caſes we ſee are Modern, and therefore more generally known by moſt of your Antient Practicers now being.

If others carpe at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they underſtand it not, or have any particular <hi>Odium</hi> to the Tongue, I deſire them not to rant at my Author, but let their Mothers Tongue hiſſe at me. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Terms and Panegyricks on the Author, or his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, with that vulgar intention of ſome, will make me ridiculous, and be diſhonorable both to his Perſon and Profeſsion. But the greateſt Rhetorick and Epethites you can endeavour at, to complement the Reporter (becauſe if there be a failer of Selling, the Stationer will ſay the <hi>Remora</hi> was in my Epiſtle, and not in the Caſes) is not ſo great as.

                  <p>ONe <hi>Blackhall</hi> petitions in the Court of <hi>Requeſts,</hi> to compel <hi>Thursby.</hi> Lord of the Mannor to admit him to a Copyhold ſurrendred to his uſe, which he refuſed before to doe. And alſo forbad one, to whom the Copyhold was demiſed by <hi>Blackhall,</hi> to pay him any rent Vpon which it was decreed that <hi>Thursby</hi> ſhould admit him to a Meſſuage, and 17 acres, whereas the Copy was of a Meſſuage, and 3 acres; and alſo that <hi>Thursby</hi> ſhould ſet forth the bounds of the Copyhold, which he had defaced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and that he pay the rent. <hi>Hitcham</hi> moved for a prohibition; for he ſaid it was more juſt for a Court of Equity to compel a Lord to admit his Copyholder; for before admittance he cannot have an action, and he has no remedy at the Common-law: And ſo if a Copyholder removes or defaces the bounds of the Copyhold, it is proper for ſuch a Court to deſign them. To which the Court agréed; but they would not compell him to admit him to the Meſſuage and 17 acres, where the Copy is but of thrée acres, which would be unjuſt; unleſs that the 3 would comprehend the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 14. But parcel or not parcel of Copyhold, belongs to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law to try. But the Court denied the prohibition for that cauſe; for the Iuſtices ſaid, that that admittance to 14 acres does not bind the title; but it ſets at liberty as to that. But if they had decreed; that he ſhould be admitted and alſo enjoy it to him and his heirs, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree had been unjuſt, and a prohibition for that. But for part of the Decree which touch'd the rent. It was agreed by the Court, if <hi>Thursby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the rents, the decree was juſt, that he ſhould pay it; but if he did not receive the rents, nor take the profits, but only forbad the Tenant to pay the rent, and he would ſave him harmleſs. Then if it was decreed that he ſhould pay the rent, a prohibition to that part ſhould be granted. And <hi>Harvey</hi> Iuſtice in that caſe ſaid; That he knew it to be adjudg'd, that a ſurrender, with the appurtenances, would paſs land; And of a Meſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and 3 acres would paſs more acres; if divers Copies ſucceſsively have been ſo. And upon queſtioning of <hi>Blackhall</hi> by the Chief Iuſtice for ſaying, that after there was a Decree in the Court of Equity, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Common-bench could not ſuperſede the Execution of it. And Iuſtice <hi>Yelverton</hi> declared, That when he was in the circuit at <hi>York,</hi> a poor man who ſued before him in <hi>forma pauperis</hi> was arreſted by proceſs from the Council of <hi>York.</hi> And that upon notice of it, he commanded a writ of privilege to be made for him, but the Officer of the Council would not obey it; upon which he claps in a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> returnable at a certain hour; and the Officer came without the body, and refuſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the priſoner; and ſaid that he had not power to controll the proceſs of the Council. And upon that he ſet a fine upon him of 40 <hi>l.</hi> and his Act

The Tenants claim common there, and a liberty to cut graſs, and make hay of it, and to carry it away. <hi>Palmer</hi> incloſes the ſoyl; <hi>Humbleton</hi> enters upon the place encloſed, and alſo takes the graſs, being one of the Tenants: And <hi>Palmer</hi> brought a Treſpaſs againſt him, and then <hi>Bucke</hi> aſſumes to the Plaintiff, in conſideration of a Iugg of Beer, and in conſideration that the Plaintiff in the Treſpaſs hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, would plead a Plea in maintenance of their title of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he immediatly would pay to him the half of his expences; or if he failed of that, he would pay him forty pounds. And further, he ſaid, that he pleaded not guilty in that action of Treſpaſs, which was found for him; and that he expended ſo much money, the half of which the Defendant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay to him, &amp;c. The Defendant pleads <hi>non defendit ſectam</hi> in maintenance of their Common, which was found againſt him. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> moved in arreſt of Iudgement; becauſe that he ought to have pleaded ſuch a Plea, by which the title of Common might come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but when he pleads not guilty, he diſclaims the matter of Common: And alſo the word immediatly is not to be taken ſo ſtrictly, that he ſhould pay the money in the ſame inſtant, &amp;c. But the Plaintiff muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what coſts he had expended, and then he ſhall have reaſonable time by the Statute to pay the money. But <hi>Athowe</hi> anſwered, that the verdict which was in the Kings Bench helps him; For it was there found, that that land was the Kings waſt, and that Palmer was not owner of the ſoyl, and therefore for that his plea was good: for the title of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cannot come in queſtion. <hi>Richardſon</hi> Chief Iuſtice ſaid, that that is not a maintenance of the title of Common againſt <hi>Palmer.</hi> Firſt, he cannot give that verdict in evidence, in a preſcription for the Common; and the maintenance by that Plea of not guilty is for the ſoyl, and not for the Common; and whoever is owner of the ſoyl, the title of Common is not ſpecially againſt <hi>Palmer,</hi> but it is general againſt every one in the world. And ſo was the opinion of <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Crook:</hi> And <hi>Crook</hi> ſaid, that although the verdict had found the Aſſumpſit, and ſo admitted, that that plea was for maintenance of the title; yet that ſhall not bind us. For if a verdict finds matter which is repugnant, or a thing which cannot come in queſtion, it ſhall not bind us. But by Iuſtice <hi>Yelverton</hi> it was ſaid; That becauſe the Iury have found the Aſſumpſit, they have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the reſidue; And for that we do not doubt of it no more than the Iury have decreed. As in an <hi>Ejectione firm.</hi> If they be at iſſue upon the collateral matter, it ſhall be admitted, that there was an ejectment, and ſo it was adjudged. But this cauſe was deferred to another time, to be argued more, &amp;c.</p>

The Defendant by rejoynder pleads, that <hi>Allen</hi> and others, that they were Deputies to receive the Tithe-wool, and that they, or one of them were preſent at the clipping: and ſo they demur. <hi>Athowe</hi> ſaid, that notice ought to be given to the Parſon himſelf, for perchance he would be there himſelf had he notice.

                     <hi>IOhn Paſton</hi> brought an <hi>Ejectione firm.</hi> againſt <hi>Manne,</hi> and a ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was given to this effect, <hi>(ſcilicet) Edward Paſton</hi> was ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Bingham,</hi> parcel whereof was the Land in queſtion, grantable by Copy. And he by his Deed indented, in conſideration of a Mariage to be had between <hi>Tho. Paſton</hi> his Son, and the Daughter of <hi>I. S.</hi> covenanted with <hi>I.S.</hi> to ſtand ſeiſ'd of the Mannor, to the uſe of his Son for life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Mary</hi> the wife for life, the remainder to the firſt Son between them in tail, with divers remainders over. The Mariage was ſolemniſed, and they found moreover, that there was a Cuſtome, that the Lord might have liberty of fould courſe for 100 Sheep, throughout all the Copihold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: lying in the Eaſt and North field, the Cuſtomary places and Lands in theſe Fields not being incloſed, from the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> to the Feaſt of the Annunciation, if the grain was carried in by that time; Or otherwiſe from the time of the carrying in to the Annunciation, if it be not ſowed with ſeed again, and that thoſe 15 acres in queſtion, be in the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. And that <hi>Thomas Paſton</hi> granted that Copihold to the Defendant in Fee, and that in 14 <hi>Iacobi,</hi> the Defendant encloſed the Land without Licence of the Lord, and if Licence was obtained then he ought to have paid a Fine which the Lord would have aſſeſt. And if any of the Tenents incloſe without Licence, they find, that they have uſed to be puniſht, and pay thoſe penalties, which the Lord would aſſeſs. And they alſo found, that that incloſer by the Copiholder, was with a Ditch of ſix foot in breadth, and 3 foot in depth, and that the land which he digged out, was but to make a Bank upon the Land, upon which a hedge of quick thorn was ſet, and that four gaps were left in the incloſure of nine feet in breadth. And they found that the Defendant did not at any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for a Fine. And then they find that the Copiholders which before this incloſed without Licence, were amerced, and commanded upon a pain, before a certain day to throw up their incloſures; And now for this incloſure <hi>Thomas</hi> enters for a forfeiture, and dies, his Wife makes a Leaſe of it, and the Defendant ejects the Leſſee,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Atthowe</hi> held that he had forfeited his Copihold, for that incloſure is againſt the Cuſtome of the Mannor, which is found. For the Cuſtome is the life and ſoul of a Copihold; as it is in the 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 31. <hi>Brownes Caſe.</hi> The breaking of that is a forfeiture, and make the Copiholder have an Eſtate at will meerly, whereas before he had an Eſtate not meerly at the will of the ſaid Lord, but <hi>ſecundum volunt. domini.</hi> And ſo by the incloſure the Lord cannot have his fould courſe, and ſo the cuſtome is broken. 42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 25. For not doing the ſervices, the Lord may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and have the Emblements. If a Copiholder makes a feoffment, it is a diſſeiſin; for which there may be an Aſsiſe of <hi>novel diſſeiſin de libero tenement</hi> of Lands, whereof the profits, or of the Rent iſſuing out of the Land there is a forfeiture. And <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid, that a reſcous Replevin Encloſure, and denying the Rent is a Diſſeiſin. And what is a Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of a Freehold is a forfeiture of the Copihold. Reſcous by a Copihol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a forfeiture, for all the books ſay, that a denial of a rent is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. And it is held, that if a Copiholder brings a replevin, it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, and the Lord may enter preſently; But if he avow, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he hath diſpenſed with it. And an incloſure is more ſtrong than a denial, 11 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 88. cited in <hi>Taverners</hi> Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> The heir cannot have an Aſsiſe before entry: but if the Defendant menaces him, or ſtops up the way, it is a Diſſeiſin, 14 <hi>Aſs. plac.</hi> 19. 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Aſ.</hi> 374. A ſtopping up of the way is a diſſeiſin; but if he can go another way, he can have nuſance 29 <hi>Aſs.</hi> 49. But it will be objected, that the Lord had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother remedy: for he might have an Action of the Caſe. And for that not enter for a forfeiture. But an Action of the Caſe does not reſtore him to the Freehold, but give dammages only. And if an Aſsiſe be brought, it affirms the Diſſeiſin, and makes forfeiture; and that agrees <hi>Taverners</hi> Caſe, That where ſeveral Copiholds were granted by one Copy, a rent denied of one, forfeits that and not the others. But admit it is a forfeiture, if the leaving the Gaps diſpence with it. And it ſeem'd that not; for he loſes the profit of the Fould-courſe, for 500 Sheep, would tear their fleeces by ſuch a narrow paſſage: and the incloſure is an impediment to hinder their ſpreading in their feeding; And ſo every one alſo may incloſe, and leave gaps: and the Lord perhaps, compell'd to put and remove the Shéep ten times in one day, and ſo the Sheep worſe at night than in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Lord had given Licence, then he would have had a Fine, but he would ſo be his own Carver. And the Lord had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for a Fine upon admittance after Surrender, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 46. He had no remedy there by Action of debt, nor by Action of the Caſe, without promiſe to the Admittance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Lord grants a Copihold Eſcheat, he ought to improve his Fine before; or he hath no remedy; for he is not compelled to grant the Copihold again, and therefore he ſhall have what Fine he will. And it is not found alſo who may incloſe paying his Fine. A Lord admits a Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder for life with remainders; the admittance of Tenent for life, was the admittance of the remainder, but he ſhall have his <hi>Antefine,</hi> 4 <hi>Rep</hi> 23. And if they may incloſe paying a Fine; then the Lord had an Eſtate at the will of the Tenents.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly when it is found that the Lord amerced and commanded upon pain, &amp;c. that is no mitigation or diſpenſation of the forfeiture. For ruinous Houſes pull'd down is a forfeiture, without Cuſtome to the contrary, Becauſe no waſte lies againſt a Copiholder, as againſt Leſſee for years, And yet the Lord in favour may amerce ſuch a Copiholder if he will; and that is no diſpenſaition but an affirmation of the forfeiture. And ſo becauſe the Lords were conſcionable and would not take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, that does not prove that it is a Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49570:10"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, the making of the gap and hedge of that latitude, &amp;c. is waſte, and for that a forfeiture. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Waſte</hi> 46. There it is agréed, that if Land be digged to make a Bank, and if more be digged than is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is waſte, if it be not caſt down again, for the Land might be made barren. 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Waſte</hi> 82. There it is not waſte, for the Land is better than it was before; But it is not better if it be arable Land, for the Trees and Buſhes ſhadow the Sun from the Land. <hi>Dyer</hi> 361. And if none had been folded there, yet it ſhould not have been waſte. Fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Meadow is waſte: but there it was found by the ſpecial verdict, that the Land was imbetterd. If Leſſee for years does ſo, it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. There it is ſaid; that permitting the Land to lye freſh is waſte; But thorny is no waſte, for the Leſs may grub the Thorns up, and it ſhall be better Land; wherefore he prayed Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Plaintiff. But Sergeant <hi>Henden</hi> argued for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and conceived that in the whole cauſe pleaded, there is not any thing in it which makes a forfeiture. There are two things in it to make that incloſure and waſte, And firſt, That an Incloſure without Licence is not a forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, every Act that makes a forfeiture of a Copyhold ought to be a diſ-inheritance to the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a voluntary Act againſt the Cuſtome, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in this Caſe there is not any Cuſtome found which makes a Forfeiture; And for that any Condition in Law is excluded: A Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder is in, <hi>tenens ſecundum conſuetudinem manerii,</hi> and therefore an Act that makes a forfeiture ought to be againſt Cuſtome, and a diſ-inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Lord of his Copihold; and not of a Collateral thing. As a Treſpaſs upon the Demeſus of the Lord is not a forfeiture, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Kell.</hi> 77. 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 76. <hi>Combes</hi> Caſe there has the ſame rule. The Cuſtome fixes his Eſtate ſo long as the Tenent does the ſervices, and obſerves the Cuſtomes. <hi>Hill.</hi> 16 <hi>Iac. Com. Banc. rot.</hi> 335. <hi>Brettyes</hi> Caſe. Two Copiholders are, and one releaſe to the other, is no forfeiture. <hi>Dyer</hi> 221. One part of the Services there was to make Preſentments, and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it is a Forfeiture. If a Copyholder fell Trees it is no Forfeiture, becauſe it may be for the reparation of Houſes. But an Act afterwards, as ſelling them, may cauſe a Forfeiture, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Waſte</hi> 39. A Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is not forfeited by Outlawry in a perſonal Action; for the Lord is not prejudiced by that; And yet the King ſhall have the profits, by which the Lord is eſtranged from the Tenement, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>New Book of Entries,</hi> 228. <hi>Hill.</hi> 4 <hi>Iac. rot.</hi> 172. <hi>Com. Banc.</hi> in the end of the Caſe reſolution is to this purpoſe. If Copyholder be ſummoned to the Court, by common Proclamation or expreſs notice, and he does not appear, it is no Forfeiture. Becauſe it is but a failer of Services, and no deniall; And for that neglect he may be puniſht and fined.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was reſolved, that non-payment of the rent, although it be a failer of Services, or if he had ſaid he could not now pay if, is not a Forfeiture; But to forge new Cuſtomes is a Forfeiture, for that tends to the diſ-inheriting of the Lord, <hi>Dyer</hi> 228. The Caſe of pay ment of a Fine which admits the diverſity appears <hi>Cook lib</hi> 1. 4 28. Now this incloſure is not a Diſ-inheritance, or a voluntary Act to eſtrange him from his Lord. And then the Cuſtome ought to make that a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture which is not ſo found. And it was a rule in <hi>P.</hi> 19 <hi>Iac.</hi> That a bare Incloſure is not a Forfeiture of a Copyhold. And then it is found, that he ſhall not incloſe without Licence, But it is not found, that if he ſhould incloſe without Licence, it ſhould be a forfeiture. And there is neither expreſs nor tacite condition that it ſhould be a Forfeiture. And then it is found that he may amerce and command that the Hedge ſhould be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down upon pain, &amp;c. The intention is not that he had two remedies;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49570:11"/> And it is not to be found in our Books, that one Act cauſes a pain, and a forfeiture alſo. And ſo the cuſtom ſhall be taken favourably for the Copy-holder, and ſtrictly for the Lord; for a forfeiture is odious in Law. 4. <hi>Rep.</hi> 9. There the Cuſtom is found, that not appearing at four Summons is expreſly a forfeiture. And to the objection that is made, that he had not any remedy for his Fine; the Verdict anſwers that, that he may put a pain upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he encloſes, and leaves three gaps: It was objected, that an Encloſure was a diſſeiſin, <hi>ergo</hi> a forfeiture. In ſome Caſes that Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhall be diſſeiſins there is no queſtion: But there is, if they be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures with gaps. The Encloſure that deprives him of all his remedy is a diſſeiſin in Rent, but otherwiſe not. For <hi>Littleton</hi> ſays, if he encloſe, that he cannot diſtrein: I conceive this diverſity. If a Copy-holder makes a diſſeiſin of any thing appertaining to the Copy-hold, it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture; for then he doth an act that eſtranges the Lord from his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but if the Lord had any profit accrewing out of the Copy-hold, and he diſſeiſeth him of that, Whether you will make that a forfeiture? As if the Lord had herbage out of the Copy-hold, a diſſeiſin of that is not a forfeiture, unleſs it be particularly by Copy of the Grant. The making of the Ditch is objected to be waſte, and therefore a forfeiture: I agree if it be waſte, it is a forfeiture. It is not a forfeiture, if a Copy-holder dig a Marle-pit and Marles his Land; for the Land is imbettered by it. It is objected, that it is a forfeiture at Common Law, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. waſte 821. If Leſſee for years plough a Meadow it is not Waſte, for it tends to a matter of Husbandry. <hi>Natura Brev.</hi> title waſte. <hi>Dyer</hi> 361. <hi>pl.</hi> 12. Leſſee for years converts Land to Hop ground: It was the opinion of <hi>Popham</hi> Lord Chief Iuſtice, 30. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that it was not waſte. And for that that the Land by this Encloſure is imbettered, it is not waſte, and the Lord had no prejudice, becauſe the gaps were left. And the Court ſaid, that it is to be preſumed, that all the Land was imbettered by this Encloſure, if it be not expreſly ſhewed to the contrary. <hi>Sed adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ELlen Bowett</hi> procured a <hi>Corpus cum Cauſa</hi> out of the Common-Pleas to the Sheriff of <hi>London;</hi> who returns that ſhe was impriſoned upon a Sute againſt her by <hi>George Langham</hi> as a Feme ſole Merchant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtome there. Now the Truth was, that her Husband being a Vintener was preſt by the King to be a Souldier: and goes over-Sea. The Feme afterwards takes an Houſe, and buys Wine of <hi>Langham,</hi> who truſted her, ſuppoſing ſhe was a <hi>Feme ſole Merchant.</hi> Afterwards the Husband returns, and the Wife denies to pay for the Wine; and the doubt was if the Feme was a ſole Feme Merchant by the Cuſtome ſo, or not: and the words of the Cuſtome were read. That where the Wife meddles in a Trade, in which the Husband may meddle nothing, ſhe ſhall have all advantages, and ſhall be ſued as a Feme ſole Merchant, &amp;c. But by <hi>Richardſon</hi> and <hi>Yelverton,</hi> Shee is not a Feme ſole Merchant within the Cuſtome; For her Husband exerciſes himſelf the ſame Trade. And a Feme ſole Merchant by <hi>Yelverton</hi> ought to be the Widow of a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who takes a ſecond Husband, and afterwards exerciſes the Trade of the firſt Husband.</p>
                  <p>Secondly ſhe ought to be a Feme Covert, and not a Virgin or Maiden.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhe ought to be of another Trade than that which her ſecond Husband was: For if ſhe may exerciſe the ſame Trade of her Husband when he is over the Sea: the Husband may go over Sea and return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year, and then ſhe is a Feme Covert, &amp;c. And ſo make her a Feme Sole or Covert at his pleaſure. And <hi>Richardſon</hi> and <hi>Yelverton</hi> ſaid, that that would be a prejudice to all the Wives in <hi>London,</hi> ſo that they would never be fréed from impriſonment. But <hi>Crook, Hutton,</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> to the contrary. And they ſaid that if the Husband meddle with the Trade
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49570:12"/> of his Wife, then ſhe is not chargeable as a Feme ſole Merchant; But if the Husband be over Sea, or become Banckrupt or relinquiſh his Trade, and the Wife exerciſeth the ſame Trade, or they both exerciſe the ſame Trade diſtinctly by themſelves, and not meddle the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, She is a ſole Merchant; or otherwiſe it would be a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. For the Wife when her Husband is over Sea, would contract and gain much Goods of others into her hands, and the parries ſhall not have any remedy. But <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that he who ſells ought to take notice, whether ſhe be Feme Covert, or feme ſole Merchant by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome or not, his peril.</p>

You may challenge me for a Coward, that I meet you not at the Croſſe, as you have challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged others, having been a Pupill in the School of Scoulding, and a rare Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt therein, But I durſt not have done it, leſt I ſhould have been ſo hoarſe, that it might have have been ſaid, I had the Pox.</hi> And the Court proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the hearing of the matter, and ſentenced the Defendant to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; and fined 40 l. to the <hi>King,</hi> and 40 l. dammages to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And Sergeant <hi>Henden</hi> moved for a Prohibition for that, that their Inſtructions are, <hi>Whereas there be divers Books, News, and Tales ſpread abroad, and Libells made, by which the Subjects are abuſed, and the Peace may be broken, you ſhall proceed againſt ſuch Perſons, till the Authors be found out, and they be puniſhed by fines, impriſonments, papers ſet on their breaſts, and the like.</hi> And he ſaid that thoſe words are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comtable at Common-law; and therfore are not as they ſeem within their Inſtructions. But admit that, yet they have not power to give damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the Party. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, In the Star-Chamber, libellous Letters, that are ſpitefull and ſcandalous to defame any, although that they bear not an Action at Common-law; yet they are puniſhable there, and alſo they give dammages to the Party wronged; But there is difference betwéen the Star-Chamber and that, &amp;c. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> makes the difference. <hi>Quod nullus liber homo capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etur aut impriſonetur niſi ſecundum legem terrae.</hi> So by the Common
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49570:12"/> Law and their inſtructions, they have not power to give damages to the party. <hi>Richardſon</hi> chief Iuſtice, ſaid that no prohibition ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Fine of the King; for they have power in that Caſe without queſtion, and to the puniſhing in that matter. And if they err in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Libellious Letter, and adjudge it to be Libellious where it is not, We cannot award a prohibition, nor grant error. But for the damages, that Court differs from the Star-chamber: for the Star-chamber had its power by its ſelf, and differs from the Common Law; But that Court is by Commiſsion, and therefore they ought to follow their Inſtructions. And therefore a prohibition as to the damages ſhall be granted. And <hi>Yelverton</hi> alſo was of the ſame opinion; but he ſaid, there was another clauſe in their Inſtructions; And for that a prohibition, as to the damages ſhall be granted, <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> ſaid, That if the ſute was by information, than it is clear that damages cannot be given. But it is by Bill, ſo in nature of an Action; as I conceive, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that they were damnified. But it is now brought too late to grant a prohibition, where the parties have admitted the action: But a day was given to ſhew cauſe, why a prohibition ſhould not be granted <hi>quoad</hi> the damages.

                  <p>Note, that it was ſaid by the Court: That if money be lent upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the Scrivener who makes the Obligation, reſerves more then 8. l. in the 100. l. That, that is not an uſurious Contract. See the cauſe, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Abrees Caſe.</head>
                  <p>MOre of the Caſe which you ſaw before, &amp;c. <hi>Henden</hi> argued that that releaſe is but ſpecial, and that it extends only to errors. And firſt, for that the intention of the parties is principally to be regarded. And <hi>ex praecedentibus &amp; conſequentibus optima fit interpretatio.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent clauſe is only a releaſe of errors, and then the conſequent ſuits: And in the laſt clauſe, <hi>releaſe all Actions,</hi> and ſuits of error before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a releaſe is particular, and may be by inference of other words have a general ſenſe; yet particular conſtruction ſhall be made, <hi>Niſi impediatur ſententia or intentio partium:</hi> For that <hi>alſo Suits</hi> in the middle of the clauſe ſhall have relation to the other words. And to that purpoſe is, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 19. A Grant to the Leſſee, that he ſhall have the Rues for hedges (by the aſsignment of the Bayliff of the Leſſor) and for neceſſary fuel to burn. And the opinion of the Court was that he ſhould have the fewel alſo by aſsignment, 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 43. 6. A man ſubmits himſelf to the Arbitrament of <hi>I.S. de omnibus actionibus perſonalibus ſectis &amp; querelis.</hi> And it was ruled that that word <hi>perſonal</hi> refers to <hi>all.</hi> And the Caſe in queſtion is the very Caſe as that in reaſon, 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. A man grants the Cuſtody of his Park, and all the <hi>Windfalls,</hi> &amp;c. And it ſeemed there, that the grant of Windfalls is abſolute: for that, that the intent cannot be otherwiſe, <hi>Paſc.</hi> 36 <hi>Eliz. banc.

D.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> And it was adjudged, that that land did not paſs by that Feoffment. For where particular words are in the end, the middle ſhall never be taken ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. And ſo alſo 8. <hi>rep.</hi> 150. <hi>Althams</hi> Caſe.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>expende circumſtantias &amp; intentio nihil intelligetur,</hi> which may be intended alſo in Suits more than <hi>in actibus:</hi> For will you have Action particular, and Suits general? And ſo the intention appears in the firſt word Errors, and the ſubſequent are but declaratory: And although that Suits is laſtly put in the ſecond Clauſe, yet there it is not but a ſurpluſage; And that which is not releaſed by the firſt <hi>(Suit)</hi> cannot be by the ſecond: For it is not but a repetition of that which was before. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> the words are, <hi>All Writs, Actions and Suits by error.</hi> Without queſtion it ſhall be intended but errors: Or if it be ſo: <hi>And all Actions and Suits of error,</hi> It cannot extend but to errors. <hi>Hutton.</hi> In that releaſe there is not any word of debt; and therefore it ſeemed that the intention was not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe other actions, but errors. And it was adjudged in this Court in a Writ of Annuity. A releaſe was pleaded that the Plaintiff acquitted him, of one payment, for half of the year, and releaſed to him all Actions. Suits and Demands; And adjudged, that that releaſe does not bar him, but of the arrearages of a year.</p>

                  <p>MOre of <hi>Beare</hi> and <hi>Hodges</hi> Caſe, you may ſee before. <hi>Davenport</hi> ſaid, that a man cannot diſtrein upon an actual demand, which ought to be to the perſon, upon the Land. And for that, the diſtreſs is tortious, and damages by the Common Law are given to him, who made the Replevin; But to the Avowant damages are only given by the ſtatute of 7. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 19. Now the Rent is not in queſtion (for it was taken to pay it) but the dammages: and the Tenant had done all that he can: and it is not reaſon that he pay any damages. And the diverſity between a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin, and debt for Rent after ſuch a tender. That a local tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes the damages, appears <hi>H.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Tidthorps</hi> Caſe, 38. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Debt.</hi> An Obligation is indorſed, to pay the money at <hi>Eaſter:</hi> and he tenders it at the day to the Obligee, who refuſes it becauſe he lives at another place. And now becauſe that no place was named for the payment, the tender was good, and ſhall excuſe him (without any other demand) of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid, that a tender of Homage excuſes, until a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. And there a difference ſeemed to ſome, between fealty and homage. But <hi>Bryan</hi> ſaid, that a tender of fealty alſo (until a new requeſt) to his perſon, excuſes damages: becauſe that fealty may be done by Attourney, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6.31. 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4.4. puts the caſe of Rent to the ſame intent. <hi>Cook, Littleton,</hi> 7. 28. <hi>Maunds</hi> Caſe. The third reſolution is a ground for our Caſe. There it is ſaid, if Terre-tenant tender a Rent ſeck, upon the Land: The Grantee cannot demand it upon the Land in the abſence of the tenant: that it ought to be to the perſon upon the land: For what can the tenant do more than he hath done already. And the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. gives eaſe to the Tenant, When the Lord diſtreins immoderately and unneceſſarily. For an immoderate diſtreſs may be the ruine of a tenant: And therefore the Statute ſays, <hi>Nec habeat Capitalis dominus poteſtatem diſtringendi tenentes in dominico ſuo, dum praedict. Tenens offerat ei ſervitia debita &amp; conſueta.</hi> 30. <hi>Aſſ. Fitzher. N. B.</hi> 69. <hi>G.</hi> If Cattel be diſtreined <hi>damage feaſant,</hi> and tender of ſufficient amends is made, The Diſtreiner is liable to damages for the detinue, although not for the diſtreſs. And to the ſame purpoſe is, <hi>Cook lib.</hi> 8. 140. <hi>Carpenters</hi> Caſe, 5. <hi>rep.</hi> 76. <hi>Pilkintons</hi> Caſe, &amp;c. The ſecond queſtion is, whether a Bayliff, without command of the Leſſor, (when he had refuſed to take the Rent upon a Lawfull tender) may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrein: And it ſeemed that he cannot. And the ſecond reſolution in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kintons</hi> Caſe came to that queſtion: That a tender of amends to a Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff amounts to nothing: And the queſtion upon a Herriot is, Whether the Leſſor may diſtrein without declaring his election; and it ſeemed that he cannot: For that is no Heriot which may be ſeized; As the Caſe in one <hi>Woodland</hi> and <hi>Mantles</hi> Caſe, there it is certain. And becauſe the Law veſts it in him immediatly after the death of the tenant. But ſo it is arbitrable, and cannot veſt before Election: and alſo the Tenant does not know which he ought to provide before, and declares his election. And it was demanded, for that it is not reaſonable that he ſhall be lyable to a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49570:15"/> diſtreſs, and cannot by any poſsibility prevent it, 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36. Sir <hi>Rowland Howards</hi> Caſe. I cannot finde any preſident where an Avowry is made upon a disjunctive reſervation, without allegation that he had declared his Election. Although that the Leſſor in that Caſe may diſtrein without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his election, yet the Bayliff cannot: for he cannot juſtifie as Bayliff for an Arbitrable thing, without expreſs command. Acceptance of Rent by a Bayliff cannot alter the Tenancy. For although that he had power in Law to receive the Rent; yet he cannot by Law alter the Tenency, by his acceptance, without the Lords Command, <hi>Dyer</hi> 222. A Bayliff may demand Rent, but cannot enter for non-payment without expreſs command: And when he avows, he cannot avow any thing, which doth not appertain to his office. And for that, that it is an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable thing, which cannot be transferred from the perſon of the Leſſor his Heirs or Aſsigns, that diſtreſs is well taken, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Whether the Leaſe in Remainder be out of the Statute 1 <hi>El.</hi> alſo that I ought to maintain, That although the Leaſe is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Statute, yet it is not void, but voidable by the Succeſſor, And that alſo contains two points.</p>

And it was adjudged, that none, can take by that Déed, but <hi>Thomas Hubbard</hi> only; Who is only the party named, and that it is no remainder, for it is not made certain, who begins to take by the Remainder. <hi>Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Tilers</hi> Caſe in the Kings Bench. There ſuch a Leaſe is made, and the word <hi>Succeſſive</hi> comes after the limitation of the Eſtate. And the Iudges gave the difference between this Caſe and <hi>Hiliards</hi> Caſe. But after in the Exchequer-Chamber, it was agreed to the contrary. So that <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive</hi> put generally does nothing; But when it is ſhew'd who takes firſt, then it makes a Remainder. <hi>Dyer</hi> 361. <hi>habendum ſucceſſive, prout nominatur in Indentura.</hi> It was ruled that that was a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And this Caſe is more ſtrong, for every one is named in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And then if it be not a Ioint-eſtate, but in remainder, it is not warrantable by the Statute of 1 <hi>El.</hi> 6. <hi>Rep. Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> Caſe of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And that Statute had relation to the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of making of Leaſes; For the Statute of 1 <hi>El.</hi> ought in reaſon and equity to have the ſame conſtructions, as the Statutes aforeſaid; and ſo it had been adjudged in one <hi>Wheeler</hi> and <hi>Danbyes</hi> Caſe. Then that Leaſe although it be void, yet is not abſolutely void, but voidable, &amp;c. And as to the point in Law, the Livery is good as it ſeemed. But now if there was a Leaſe for life, or a Feoffment <hi>de die datus,</hi> and Livery made the ſame day, by the Feoffor himſelf or his Attorney, that it ſhould be void.

Dower. So that a thing grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot be, to begin at a day to come; But not by the reaſon only given, that he cannot reſerve a particular Eſtate to himſelf; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Frank-tenement which ought to paſs preſently, <hi>Paſc.</hi> 5: <hi>Iac.</hi> Kings Bench, Sir <hi>Robert Iames</hi> Caſe. In a Replevin againſt him and <hi>Adams</hi> it was agreed; That if a Reverſion be bargained and ſold at a day to come for years, it is good. And ſo alſo is Sir <hi>Rowland Haywards</hi> Caſe. 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 35. If a Feoffment or a Leaſe for life was <hi>a die datus.</hi> If the Leſſor or a Perſon the next day make Livery it is good without queſtion. For the abſurdity that a Frank-tenement ſhould be in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is not ſo: for the life is given by the Livery after the date. And there is a great difference between things that lye in Grant, and a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment. For in Caſe of a Grant, that is a <hi>die datus,</hi> it cannot be made good. In Caſe where a Feoffment is made, the Deed is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all is not done before the Livery. But in the other Caſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Livery, nothing is to be done by the other, And that is the reaſon of <hi>Buckleys</hi> Caſe, That an attournment cannot make the Grant good, or the form of a Deed. But where Livery is, it paſſes by Livery only, where no Eſtate is mentioned. Alſo one <hi>Bowles</hi> and <hi>Smyths</hi> Caſe. The Prebend of <hi>Bowe</hi> makes a Leaſe for 3 lives, <hi>a die datus,</hi> and makes Livery after the day; Adjudged that the Leaſe and Livery were good; as it is in <hi>Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Tilers</hi> Caſe in the Kings Bench, <hi>Trin.</hi> 10 <hi>Iac. rot.</hi> 1039. &amp; 18 <hi>Iac.</hi> Argued at Serjeants Inne.

                     <hi>Ioan</hi> his Daughter, <hi>habendum</hi> at Michaelmas next after the date of the Indenture, for lives ſucceſsively. The Leſſor and his wife after the day paſt makes livery in perſon, <hi>ſecundum formam chartae. Longe</hi> dies, and <hi>Alice</hi> receives the rent of <hi>Fiſher.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Alice</hi> and <hi>Ioan</hi> cannot take jointly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Ioan</hi> cannot take a greater Eſtate than for her own life, and not <hi>pur autur vie.</hi> For it was not the meaning of the Deed. But there they held, that the Succeſſor after the lives, was the Remainder. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a Writ of Errror it was denied.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That that acceptance of the rent tyes the Wife; Which could not be unleſſe the rent remain good. For the aſſent ought to be manifeſt by Deed. So that the Deed is good to direct the eſtate. and prove the Aſſent. For otherwiſe the Feoffment ſo had avoided the leaſe. But where the Perſon is diſabled it is otherwiſe. As if a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be made by a Feme Covert, and livery made by Attorny, the Deed is void.</p>
                  <p>But now the grand doubt is, whether the livery after the day by Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be good. I will agree that if the letter of Attorny was made the ſame day, that the deed bore date, the livery is void. For it ſhal not be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of an Attorny to invalidate or validate the leaſe made by an other. So if a letter of Attorny be contained in a Charter of feoffment, or be in another Deed, delivered at the ſame day; The delivery upon that Deed ſhall be nought. And the Attorney by his livery cannot make the leaſe or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment good, no more than (in <hi>Bucklers</hi> Caſe) an atturnment can make a Grant good. 9 <hi>Iac. com. banc. rot.</hi> 1414. <hi>Walter,</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> Caſe of <hi>Worceſter</hi> cited before. In a Writ of covenant. There a leaſe was made by E. for three lives bearing date the 10 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 42. <hi>E.</hi> and a letter of Attorney to deliver ſeiſin. The Attorney delivered ſeiſin a year after, when two rent daies were incurred. And it was doubted whether that livery was good: becauſe that two rent daies were paſſed, before he had executed his Authority. And it was adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged good. And it was not like the Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> Caſe, 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> Where a performance of a Condition for the avoidance of an advowſon was void, no time being limitted. For in Caſe of authority, it may be executed 10 years after. So that what the Feoffor himſelf may do, he may give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to another to do that. For if he be bed-rid, or other infirmity, ſhall the law ſo fetter him, that what he can do himſelf, he cannot in the ſame Caſe do by any other? For although you may ſay, that he may make a new leaſe: yet perhaps he is tyed by Covenants or Obligations ſo, by which he ſhall be worſe intangled. And the reaſon of the expectancy of the Frank-tenement alſo, which an Attorney may make good or bad; a leaſe of another is included. Becauſe where it is miſchievous to none, the law does not envy the Eaſe of the party, as Combes Caſe is. A Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, by an Attorney of a Copihold is good: and we can (you know) appear by Attorney in actions, and acknowledge Iudgements. But it will be objected, that livery by Attorney is not good without a Charter of Feoffment, as <hi>Kirkby</hi> ſaid, 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 51. <hi>Plo.</hi> 6. And if thoſe Books are not law. Yet <hi>Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Tilers</hi> Caſe, before recited, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that doubt; That the Deed is not void if the livery be after; and if the Entry be preſently, he is a Tenent at will, or a Diſſeiſor, as it is in <hi>Bucklers</hi> Caſe, For it cannot be made good by any thing after. Yet the Déeds remain, or otherwiſe his acceptance did not bar him. I confeſs that an Authority to make livery cannot be made by <hi>Paroll,</hi> as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49570:20"/> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. for it may be revoked by <hi>Paroll.</hi> As a Will which cannot be made but by writing, yet it may be revoked by <hi>Paroll.</hi> 26 <hi>Aſ.</hi> But an authority to make a Leaſe is made by <hi>Paroll,</hi> 30 <hi>E.</hi> 3.31, 32. If a Déed purporting an Eſtate in Fee ſimple be read to the Feoffor, who is an illiterate man, to paſs only an Eſtate tail; And a Letter of Attorney was to deliver ſeiſin <hi>ſecundum formam Chartae,</hi> which is well read to him; Yet it was reſolved that all is void. And that he may plead it was not his deed, to the letter of Attorny. For if the Deed be void, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney which releaſes to it is void alſo. But I conceive, if it be put in a Deed that gives Land <hi>a die datus,</hi> and the Attorney authoriſed by expreſs words, delivers ſeiſin three daies before; that livery may be good. And then it is more ſtrong when he appoints his Attorney after the day; as it is in this Caſe. A Feoffment made from a day paſt is good, and the time before the livery is idle. And for another reaſon in Caſe of Aſſurances ſuch nice conſtructions ought not to be made. And becauſe there is no difference whether livery be made in Perſon or by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney. Now there is a difference between an Authority and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>H.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in an <hi>Ejectione firm.</hi> in this Court, <hi>Marriots</hi> Caſe. A Charter of Feoffment was made to the Leſſor of the Plaintiffs, 10 <hi>Septemb.</hi> And the Feoffee reciting that that Charter was made the 11 of <hi>September,</hi> authoriſed him to take livery <hi>ſecundum formam Chartae.</hi> And it was reſolved, becauſe the date was miſtaken, although all other circumſtances agreed; Becauſe that the authority ought to be taken ſtrictly, that that is a void livery. But in <hi>Dyer</hi> 116. A Leaſe is made the 30 day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for 21 years, and afterwards the Leſſor reciting that the Leaſe was made the 6th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> demiſes the Land <hi>habendum</hi> after the firſt Leaſe determined. And it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a good Leaſe: becauſe that the beginning and ending of the Leaſe agreed; And in the Caſe of <hi>Marriot,</hi> it was reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That an Attorny cannot be without Deed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although that the Feoffor in perſon makes livery, yet it is void; Becauſe that the Attorney cannot take the livery upon that Deed without that authority. But where that one may do that thing himſelf, and he gives the Attorney the ſame authority: It is all one if Feoffment be made to <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> makes an Attorney to take livery, whereof livery is made, yet is good; And it is all one, as if livery had been made to <hi>I.S.</hi> himſelf. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. A Feoffment upon Condition that he enfeoff <hi>I. S.</hi> void by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> or voidable: and it ſeemed it was but voidable by the Succeſſor, by entry or by action. You may ſée that the words are as plain as may be. <hi>They ſhall be utterly void to all intents and purpoſes.</hi> But <hi>quid haeret in litera.</hi> For her meaning was, That it ſhall be void by the Succeſſor, and that conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had alwaies been made 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 19. 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 73. So the Statute 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. of Sheriffs had been expounded. 7 E. 4. 4. There cannot be <hi>non eſt factum</hi> pleaded. And upon the Statute of Vſury; That an uſurious contract ſhall be void; Yet the Statute ought to be pleaded. Acts of Parliament where there are many doubts, ſhall be expounded by the Common law; For that, that at the Common law a Free-hold cannot he helped but by Entry. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. There is a diverſity between a Leaſe for years, and a Leaſe for life. <hi>Dyer</hi> 222. And it is the dignity of a free-hold to reduce it by free-hold. Then if it ſtood with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; It is not to be void without Entry. For as a ſolemn Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny created, the ſame muſt defeat it. The Statute ſhall be ſo expounded. And if it was in Caſe of a leaſe years of a Biſhop, it ſhall not be void without Entry. 3 <hi>Rep. Pennants</hi> Caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 229. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 11 E. 3. <hi>Commen.</hi> 139. It was never the meaning of the Act to make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49570:21"/> it actually void. For if the words are purſued ſtrictly, then it ſhall be void immediately againſt the Biſhop himſelf. Then the Succeſſor in lieu of a benefit, ſhall take an advantage of the Statute; For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make Leaſes but of things uſually demiſed, 32 <hi>Eliz. Sale</hi> and <hi>Sale</hi> againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> in a <hi>Quare impedit.</hi> It was adjudged, That a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> well lies by an Executor for diſturbance made to the Teſtator. And alſo that a Leaſe for years is good, notwithſtanding the Statute. The Statute does not intend the benefit of the Leſſee, but of the Succeſſor himſelf: And the Succeſſor had his Election to accept the Rent or the Land: And if it ſhould be voyd, his Election is gone. <hi>Tallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Dentons Caſe</hi> 4. <hi>Jac.</hi> A Leaſe is made by the Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> of the Tithes which is out of the Statute: And there it is void againſt the Succeſſor. For that, that he hath no remedy, for the Rent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon it. And that point is ſo adjudged upon the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz. Walters</hi> Caſe before reſolved, that a Leaſe made by Dean and Chapter, not warranted by the Statute, is but voydable againſt the Succeſſor, <hi>Paſ.</hi> 6 <hi>Iac. rot.</hi> 1041. <hi>Wheeler</hi> and <hi>Danbies</hi> Caſe: <hi>Robert</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> makes a Leaſe to <hi>Iaſper, habendum a die datus,</hi> to him for life, the remainder to <hi>William,</hi> rendring the ancient Rent. The firſt Leſſee dies, the Succeſſor having notice of it, and that divers Rents were behinde, commanded his Bayliff, that he ſhould receive the Rents. The Bayliff enters them, and receives Rent of that Leſſee, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop having notice of it. And theſe points were reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Iury finding a Leaſe, <hi>a die datus,</hi> might be intended good, for that the Entry was made after the day: yet the Iury finding a thing impoſsible, does not conclude the Iudges.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that a Leaſe in remainder is not warranted by the Statute, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Leaſe was but voydable by the Succeſſor: for the Statute was made for the benefit of the Succeſſor, but the grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, of the manner of acceptance, and reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the acceptance binds the Biſhop, and the Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Bayliff, and alſo his receipt. For it differs where the Bayliff of his own accord receives Rent. <hi>Dyer.</hi> And they alſo ſay, that that was to perfect an eſtate ſetled. And it differs from an Attournment, which is to perfect an eſtate ſetled: For there notice is requiſite, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>HEndon</hi> ſaid, that a <hi>Scire facias</hi> does not lie upon that record: becauſe an action of debt well lies: For no preſident can be ſhewn, that a Iudgement given in an inferiour Court, may be executed ſo. For firſt, that Court ſhall not make an Inſtrument to execute Iudgement given in another Court. It is ſeen that an Attaint lies of falſe Iudgement given in an inferiour Court. Take the Caſe in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4.4. And ſo if iſſue be joyned in an inferiour Court without cuſtom: It ſhall not be removed to be tryed ſo, And ſo it is our Caſe, &amp;c. Secondly, the Statutes do not give them power <hi>(viz.)</hi> 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. makes the matter clear that it cannot be. Error in an Aſsize before the Iuſtices of Aſsize, will not lye in this Court. For Iudges Itinerant are ſuperior. And thoſe Iudges are appointed by Act of Parliament; and ſo the Iudges alſo in <hi>Wales</hi> are by Act of Parliament: And having power <hi>a Oyer et terminer.</hi> It is not found that after Iudgement a <hi>Certiorari</hi> had been received to remove the Record out of an Inferiour Court: And the miſchief would be, if Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given for 20. l. it ſhould be executory through all the Realm, where they have but a ſpecial Iuriſdiction. And alſo the tenor of the Record is only removed, and execution cannot be out of the tenor of the Record. <hi>Dyer</hi> 369. <hi>Plow.</hi> 52. <hi>Richardſon.</hi> The queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49570:21"/> when the Record is ſo removed, whether it ſhall be idle: If Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given in an Inferiour Court, which holds Plea by preſcription, or by grant, and removed by Writ of Error, if the Iudgement be affirmed we may award Execution. 16 <hi>Iac.</hi> There is an expreſs preſident of a Iudgement in an Inferiour Court and <hi>a Scire facias</hi> is granted ſo. And alſo <hi>a Scire facias</hi> is granted in lieu of an action of debt. For by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law he might not have <hi>a Scire facias</hi> after the year; but an action of debt. And by the Common Law debt lies in that Caſe. <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> Iuſtices, ſaid, that Court ſhall not be an Inſtrument to execute Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an inferiour Court, which they cannot. And alſo the Land of the Defendant ſhall be lyable to an execution in any place in <hi>England:</hi> where before only the Land within the place was lyable. And alſo the purchaſer could never finde out what executions might be upon the Land. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that the miſchief would be great on both ſides. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what Iudgement was given: The Defendant would remove his goods out of the Iurisdiction of the Court, and then the Plaintiff had no remedy but by new original. And <hi>Crook</hi> Iuſtice. If a man brings an action in a Court, he ought to examine what the end of that will be. For it is a preſident, a man ought to reſpect things in their end. For it is his own folly to commence an action, where he cannot have execution. For that, he may commence his action, and have execution in any place in <hi>England,</hi> And although that a forrain Plea in an Inferiour Court may be tryed ſo, yet it is by Act of Parliament <hi>(viz.)</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 12. which proves by the Common Law there was no remedy.</p>

                  <p>MOre of the Caſe of the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Wilcocks,</hi> Mr. of Arts in St. <hi>Mary</hi> Hall in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was ſued in the Chancellors Court there, by <hi>Anne</hi> wife of <hi>Ralph Bradwell</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> her daughter; For calling the wife <hi>Bawd, and old Bawd;</hi> and the daughter; <hi>Whor., and ſcurvey pockey-faced whore.</hi> And they procured two Sentences againſt <hi>Wilcocks,</hi> and upon them he had two prohibitions: And <hi>Davenport</hi> moved for a <hi>Procedendo:</hi> for that, that by their Charter which was confirmed by Parliament, The Chancellor or his Deputy ſhall have Conuſans of all cauſes perſonal, where one of the parties is a Scholar, And the Charter was ſhewed in Court, which was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That they ſhall hold Pleas, &amp;c. or <hi>Secundum morem Univerſitatis,</hi> or <hi>Secundum legem terre.</hi> And the cuſtom was to proceed according to the Civil Law. And it was reſolved:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the King by his Charter deprives the ſubject of his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Priviledge of Tryal: As he cannot by his Letters Patents alter the nature of Gavelkinde Land; but by preſcription he may alter it in particular places: As 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>In corpus cum cauſa</hi> to the Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was certified that the priſoner, <hi>Pro extenſione detentus fuit &amp; convictus.</hi> And an exception was taken for that, that he ſhould have been indicted and convicted: and it was anſwered that it was <hi>Mos Univerſitatis,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49570:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> And by <hi>Hutton</hi> Iuſtice. That cuſtom was to be intended to be by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. But ſo the Charter is confirmed by Act of Parliament, it is as good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that there is a good cauſe of action in the Chancellors Court. For <hi>Wilcocks</hi> who is one of the parties is a Scholar, and the Charter was only made for the eaſe of Scholars, that their Studies might not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by Sutes in other Courts: But then he ought to be a Scholar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the Vniverſity at the time of the Sute commenced there. And he ought to be only one of the parties. And for that, if another be joyned with him, he ſhall not have the priviledge or benefit of the Charter: as it is 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 21. and by <hi>Richardſon</hi> chief Iuſtice, that is not a priviledge which may be waved: for every perſon may <hi>Recuſare jura introducta pro ſe:</hi> But that it was an exempt Iuriſdiction, and differs where the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge goes to the perſon. As if a Clerk, in his Court will ſue in another Court, or ſuffer himſelf to be ſued, that is a Waver of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that a <hi>Proeedendo</hi> ſhall not be granted, for that, the Charter is not pleaded; for the Iudges give Iudgement of the Record, and the cauſe of their Iudgement ought to appear by pleading of the Record. And alſo a prohibition is granted where by Demurrer, or by Pleading, and not by verbal ſurmiſe there ought to be a diſcharge. And in the caſe of a prohibition, It is not like the Caſe of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24. Where Conuſans is one time allowed by Charter ſhewn, and another Record there ſhould be allowed without demand, without other ſhewing: But <hi>Yelverton</hi> Iuſtice, to the contrary, That it might be remanded upon pleading of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And he ſaid, that there was a difference, where the ſuggeſtion was upon matter of Fact, as preſcription, &amp;c. Where an iſſue may be taken, there it ought to be pleaded in writing, which appears fully by the mean of the Court, and not by ſuggeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was reſolved that a prohibition may be granted, in caſe where the Court cannot give other remedy, for the eaſe of the Subject, who is the party; as it was adjudged in the Court of Requeſts: Vpon the cuſtom of <hi>London,</hi> concerning Orphans, a prohibition was granted; and yet no remedy at Common Law was afterwards to be expected, <hi>Trin</hi> 5. <hi>Car.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, for that, that it is a new Rent created by the Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. For when that Land is granted to the King by Parliament, yet the King hath operation upon it, and may diſpoſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Land paſſed from the Prieſt and others, by their aſſent confirming it.

The releaſe was made 1 <hi>May,</hi> as this, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Attourney, and by Attourney authoriſed the ſame day, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>May.</hi> And it was adjudged to be void by the ſame reaſon. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and <hi>Tilers</hi> Caſe. He had much inſiſted upon that: yet in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Caſe, this point was reſolved. That if the Livery was by Attourney, it ſhould be void, and the reaſon there was, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the deed was void, yet the Livery made in perſon ought to be good. But the Deed can never by Livery be made good, which was void to that purpoſe. And it had been ſaid and objected, that it might be done in perſon, and therefore by Attourney. I agree that by that Livery an Eſtate paſſes, but not by the Deed. But the Livery makes it paſs out of the Intereſt that the Leſſor had. But by that reaſon that ſuch a Leaſe ſhall be good, where Livery is by the Leſſor himſelf, will not ſtand with our Caſe. And divers Caſes declare this difference. 23 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 31, 32. A Deed of Feoffment is made by <hi>Mawbry,</hi> where he had nothing in the Land, and after purchaſes and makes Livery, <hi>Secundum formam Chart.</hi> That eſtate paſſes but not by the Deed. But if Livery had been there made by Attourney it had not been good. If a Feme Covert, or a Monk makes ſuch a Charter of Feoffment, and after Coverture or deraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49570:23"/> Makes livery then by Attorny: ſuch livery then cannot be good; For he cannot exceed his authority, which was to make good his firſt Deed. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6 32. A feoffment of a Mannor by Deed of two acres, all paſs, not by deed but by livery; but if by Attorny otherwiſe it is; Livery according to deed, (where there is not any) by Attorny is void. <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> 64. A leaſe made by Baron and Feme may be pleaded without Deed. Coparceners agregate cannot make a Leaſe without Deed; But a Biſhop or a ſingle Corporation may: and it ſhall be good againſt him, but not againſt his Succeſſor; <hi>Dyer</hi> 19. 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid, Where an Eſtate paſſes by Deed, then the Livery is but a Ceremony. And in the Chapter of Conditions, he in the remainder ſhall be bound by Condition in the Deed. Becauſe that he took by that. So that by your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you would make that acknowledgement and inrollment by the Grantor himſelf, to be a Ceremony; and yet nothing paſs.

The Declarations are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of ſheep, without expreſsing the number; and for that the Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is good in the generalty; and now when the replication is of 200 ſheep, and does not ſay <hi>alias,</hi> it is naught. <hi>Hutton,</hi> It is not directly put, that the Chauntry land is parcel of the Mannor, and then we cannot ſo intend it, and yet by the Demurrer it is confeſſed. <hi>Richarſon,</hi> It is not ſufficient to ſay, that they were <hi>levant</hi> and <hi>couchant</hi> upon the Chauntry fold; without ſaying <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that they were parcel of the Mannor.

                  <head>Robert Barret againſt Margaret Barret his Mother.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RObert Barret</hi> brought an action of debt againſt his Mother, for an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation made to him, the Condition whereof was thus. <hi>That ſhe ſhall perform all that part of her Husbands Will, that of her part is to be performed, and obſerved concerning the Goods, &amp;c. And that ſhe ſhall uſe, occupy and enjoy all the Lands and Tenements to her demiſed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true intent and meaning of the Will.</hi> The Defendant recites the Will, which was, that her Husband gave her one Meſſuage and Land for her life; <hi>Excepting all the Timber Trees and Wood.</hi> And further will'd, <hi>That ſhe make no waſte nor eſtrepment in the Houſes, Lands or Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees, nor her Aſsigns nor any other for her.</hi> And further will'd, <hi>That if ſhe ſhall happen to do any ſuch waſte; That then ſhe ſhall pay to</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barret <hi>the double value of that to which the waſte ſhall come or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto; Being indifferently valued by two choſen by themſelves.</hi> And furthermore he willed, That there ought to be forty load of Wood <hi>per annum,</hi> taken for fewel upon the Land demiſed, of ſuch Trées which have been uſed to be lopped for 30 years before. And ſo ſhe pleaded, that ſhe performed the Covenant in all, &amp;c. And the Plaintiff replies, that the Defendant had decouped a Grove of Wood, containing by eſtimation one moyety of an acre, and 6 Elmes, and 20 Beeches and Sallows, and Maples, and Thorns, being of the age of 33 years. Whereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant demurred. But <hi>Atthow</hi> argued for the Defendant, and he ſaid, That there is not any breach of the Obligation alleged, all Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees are excepted; And becauſe when ſhe cuts them, there is no waſte, but a treſpaſs to <hi>Robert;</hi> And the Will is, That ſhe ſhall not do waſte. For if ſhe had entred into other Lands and cut Trees out of the Lands of the demiſe, that had not been a Forfeiture of the Obligation. But it ſhall be objected, That then that clauſe had been void; if his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not be conſtrued of waſte to be done in the Trees; Then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond breach is not well aſsigned; For the words are, If ſhe does waſte, that ſhe pay the double value. And then although that waſte be done, You ought to allege that ſhe did not pay the double value: for if ſhe had paid it her Obligation is ſaved. But <hi>Hitcham</hi> the Kings Sergeant on the contrary. The breach is well aſsigned. The Caſe reſts upon the words of the Obligation, and the intention of the Will: and then the Intention will appear, That ſhe cannot commit waſte in the Trees, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be excepted. And I conceive it is within the words, for it is that ſhe occupy and enjoy the Lands demiſed as aforeſaid. Now if I grant my Land, I ought to demiſe my Trees alſo. And if I be obliged not to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49570:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> commit Eſtrepment in my Land, If I pull down a Houſe, it is a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Obligation. For if Tenent at will pulls down, no waſte lies againſt him, But he ſhall be puniſht by an action of the Caſe, for it is deſtruction and waſte at the Common law, <hi>In any of the Houſes, Lands, or Timber trees.</hi> And what Timber trees may be meant. But thoſe are excepted, when all are excepted. <hi>Dyer</hi> 323. <hi>Pl.</hi> 29. After the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Nothing was left in the Feoffees al uſe. One would ſtand ſeiſed with his Feoffees to the uſe of <hi>I. S.</hi> And adjudged that that is a good demiſe of the Land. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. conveys the Manor of <hi>Framing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in fee farm, and afterwards grants the Fee farm: and the Grantee demiſes his Mannor of <hi>Framingham,</hi> &amp; the Fée farm paſſed; for that that it was uſually called by that name. And <hi>Thorntons</hi> Caſe 3 <hi>El.</hi> He gives all his Land that he purchaſed of <hi>I. S.</hi> And he did not purchaſe any of <hi>I. S.</hi> but <hi>I. S</hi> had conveyed it to <hi>I. D.</hi> of whom he had purchaſed. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged good, Sir <hi>Edward Cleeres</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 6. 17. So there it ought to be of ſuch waſte, as he in his apprehenſion eſteemed to be waſte. But it may be objected, that ſhe did not pay the double value. But I conceive, That if you will that that be paid, yet the Will is broken. For if you will by one clauſe that ſhe commits not waſte, and by another if ſhe do, that ſhe pays the double value, and ſhe does not pay it, ſhe breaks two clauſes. That ought to be pleaded by you. If the Statute prohibit a thing, and if he offend againſt it, that he ſhall pay, &amp;c. I ſay that he may be indicted upon the very Prohibition. So that you would ſhew this in excuſe of Waſte. But I conceive that it is not excuſed upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>H</hi> 6. <hi>Richardſon</hi> chief Iuſtice. All the Obligation goes to the intention of the Will, which may be collected by circumſtances out of the Will. And then the ſir Elmes are meerly the others, not the Sallows, Maples, Beeches, and Thorns, by which the intention is broken. Now the Law will not allow that to be waſte which is not any ways preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Inheritance. So when the Husband ſaid, ſhe ſhall not commit waſte, It was not his intention to reſtrain her from that which the Law allows. Thorns in ſome Counties are adjudged waſte, where Trees are ſcant. But a Grove ordinarily is Vnder-wood. And then if ſhe committed waſte, the Husband took upon him to impoſe the penalty. And although that ſhe enter into an Obligation, yet it is that ſhe is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Will of her Husband, and he intended it for a benefit by that impoſition of forfeiture; and therefore we ought make a benign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And for the Obligation that the non-payment of the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be ſhewed by the Defendant, I conceive otherwiſe. For the breach ought to be averr'd, as the Will is. And where a breach is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a forfeiture. It ought to be pleaded, ſo that it may be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed. <hi>Cook</hi> on the contrary. If the Obligation be that ſhe perform the Will, then peradventure that ſhall be no forfeiture.</p>

                     <hi>PErryman</hi> brought a Replevin againſt <hi>Bowden</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> who made a Recogniſance in the name of <hi>Bedle.</hi> And the Caſe was thus. A rent is granted payable at Michaelmas and the Annunciation; And if it be in arrear by 40 daies after any day of payment, upon the demand at ſuch a place, he might diſtrain. And it is not ſhewed that he demanded it; And for that a demurrer. <hi>Atthowe,</hi> it is not requiſite to ſhew a demand, for the diſtreſs it ſelf is a demand. And it was adjudged in this Court; If a Rent be granted, and that he may without demand diſtreyn; and good without demand. And the words (if it be demanded) are material; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is demandable in a Collateral place, out of the Land charged. <hi>Crook,</hi> Grant of a rent, and that I pay it at Michaelmas allwaies, if it be demanded at my Houſe; there ought to be a demand. And ſuppoſe it was to be demanded in ſuch a place, upon the Land; I conceive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ought to be made accordingly. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> A Leaſe was made rendring a rent payable at ſuch a day: upon Condition that if the rent be not paid at ſuch a day without demand, That the Leſſor may reenter. And adjudged that no demand is now requiſite. For <hi>modus et conventio vincunt legem, &amp;c. Sed adjurnatur.</hi>

                  <p>THe Plaintiff was an Attorney who ſued by attachment of Privilege; And now the Court would not permit the amendment; Becauſe there was a material Error, for it is to the diſadvantage of the King.

If the contingency had been void at the time of the limitations; I agree it ſhould be void.

And <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Walter</hi> took nothing but after the death of the Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> without Iſſue.

As if a Feoffement be made to the uſe of one for life, and if he had no Heir of his body, to another in fee; that is contingent during the life; And he had not but an Eſtate for life, by that limitation; and then that is deſtroyed by the Fine alſo.

And the Court does never extend words further than the Law directs them. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Stawloeps</hi> Caſe and <hi>Hexts</hi> Caſe, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. <hi>Barhams</hi> Caſe. The Court there does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that which the words doe not directly imply. And here in this Caſe where the words may have a qualification, they ſhall be taken <hi>in mitiori ſenſu. Henden.</hi> The word <hi>kill</hi> generally will bear an Action, becauſe that it ſhall be intended to be felonionſly, as in the Lady <hi>Cockains</hi> Caſe. Although it was not Felony <hi>in facto.</hi> But here the words ſo ſpoken and particularly applyed, they will not bear an Action They had a diſcourſe of his skill in Surgery, and of one <hi>Matthew,</hi> who was ſick of a dangerous diſeaſe. Then that cannot to be intended, it was Felony; objecting the fayler of skill, will not bear an Action. As if I ſhould ſay of a Lawyer, <hi>He hath loſt his Clients Cauſe.</hi> And as it may be taken <hi>in mitiori ſenſu,</hi> it cannot be ſtrained to Perjury. And ſo here there can never be intended a voluntary killing. But <hi>Bramſton</hi> and <hi>Finch</hi> on the other ſide. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are not theſe words <hi>Tunc exiſtenti Chirurgeon,</hi> yet there are other words which ſupply them; for it is, That when <hi>Matthews</hi> was under his cure, he was a Chirurgeon, &amp;c. And the words are actionable without other reaſon; for that he impeaches his credit, and implies misbehaviour in his Art. <hi>Hutton.</hi> For the Exceptions we ought to intend that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Surgeon, and that his skill continued. And alſo it is ſupplyed. <hi>Then being ſpeech of his skill,</hi> &amp;c. Which proves that then he was a Sureon. And <hi>Then</hi> ought to be intended that he is a Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is not to be ſuppoſed that he laid aſide his profeſsion in the mean time. And for the words if he had ſaid, <hi>For lack of skill of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou didſt kill him,</hi> will bear an Action; for that is a ſlander to his profeſsion. And if one had ſaid, <hi>Goe not to ſuch a one, for he hath no skill in Chirurgery,</hi> if he be a Chirurgeon, if is actionable. Or if of a Lawyer, <hi>Goe not to ſuch a one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for he will deceive you.</hi> And the Queſtion will be, whether it ought to be intended that he killed him for want of skill. If one ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Such a one was found dead, and you killed him,</hi> there it ſhould be intended murderouſly. And for the Caſe put by <hi>Crew.</hi> I agree that a man may be a cauſe that another hangs himſelf by imagination. But if one ſayes, You did kill ſuch a one as hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or cut his own throat, that will bear an Action. And ſo it ought to be intended alſo, that when he ſayes of a Chirurgeon, <hi>&amp;c. That it was for want of skill. Goe not to ſuch an Inne, the Plague hath been lately there.</hi> Theſe words are actionable, for it drives away Gueſts. Then theſe words were ſpoken to hinder him in his profeſsion and benefit. And becauſe that he dyed under his hands, it ought to be neceſſarily intended, that it was for want of skill. <hi>Harvey</hi> of the ſame Opinion. Alſo there is ſufficient matter to prove that he was a Chirurgeon at the time of the ſpeaking the words, &amp;c. When he came to the words, it is ſaie that there was a ſpeech between them, &amp;c. and the ſpeech was of his skill, and of <hi>Matthews</hi> death. If he had ſaid, Thou haſt killed <hi>I. S.</hi> or murthered <hi>I. S.</hi> whereas he is living, that will not bear an Action. And ſo alſo it was that he dyed of his diſeaſe it muſt be by conſequence, that he did not kill him. But it is ſaid that he dyed, that may be by killing. And for that, the word <hi>kill</hi> without doubt will bear an Action; for if it be not murther, it may be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49570:45"/> Man-ſlaughter And ſo it ſhall be intended if you cannot make a Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, as a Miniſter of Iuſtice, or <hi>ſe defendendo.</hi> And then when he ſayes that he killed him, it ſhall be meant for want of skill, which is actionable. <hi>I. S. hath no more Law than a Horſe.</hi> If he had reſembled him to any thing but a Beaſt, it would not maintain an action. But if he ſaid, <hi>Goe not to ſuch a one.</hi> &amp;c. it is actionable without queſtion. Slander of one in his Trade, will bear an action. And ſo all being connexed alike, it ought to be intended that he killed him in reſpect of his skill. In Caſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation Sir <hi>George Haſting's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Thou didſt lye in wait to kill me with a Piſtoll,</hi> were actionable. So if one touch another in reſpect of his skill in that that he profeſſes, it will maintain an action, &amp;c. And <hi>Yelver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; for there is a difference between a Profeſsion, and a particular Calling. As if words are ſpoken of one that is a Iuſtice of Peace, he ought to ſhew that he was then a Iuſtice of Peace, for he is removable, and may be changed every Quarter Seſsions. But as to a Calling, the Calling of every man is his Free hold, 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Grant of an Annuity to one <hi>pro conſilio,</hi> and he profeſſes Divinity, Phyſick, and Law, there the grant is <hi>pro conſilio</hi> generally, for Phyſick if that be his uſuall Profeſsion. And it is intended that a man alwayes dyes in his Calling. If he ſaid to <hi>I. S.</hi> Thou art a murtherer, it ſhall not be intended of Hares for the Iudges are not to ſearch ſo far for conſtruction. <hi>Loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ut vulgus intelligendum et ſapiens.</hi> If one ſayes of a Merchant, <hi>Put not your Son to him, for hee'l ſtarve him to death.</hi> Theſe words are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; for that that it comes within the compaſſe of the diſgrace of his Profeſsion. And ſo of a School-maſter, <hi>Put not your Son to him, for hee'l come away as very a dunce as he went. Harvey.</hi> If one ſayes of a Iudge, <hi>He is a corrupt Iudge,</hi> it cannot be meant of his body to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, but it ſhall be intended of his Profeſsion.</p>

                  <head>Peitoes Caſe, before.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HEnden</hi> for the Defendant, the Caſe is thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Rent is granted for life out of Lands which deſcend to the Heir, and he makes a Leaſe of parcell of the Land to the Grantee for years, who ſurrenders the term. Whether the Rent ſhall revive or ſuſpend during the term. And it was ſaid by him, it ſhall revive. Firſt, For that that it is the act of him, who is lyable to the Rent, to accept the ſurrender. And there is a difference, where there is a determination barely by the act of the party, there it ſhall not be revived. For the firſt, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. Tenant in Tayl of a Rent is infeoffed of Land, and he makes a Feoffment of Land with a warranty to <hi>B.</hi> with Voucher, as of land diſcharged of that Rent. And ſo it is 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 55. <hi>Aſcue</hi> put this Caſe, Grantee of a rent in Fee and Donee in Tayl of Land, infeoffs the Grantee, who grants that over; and afterwards the iſſue in Tayl recovers in a <hi>Formedon,</hi> yet the rent ſhall not be revived. But if it had been the joynt act of the parties, as ſo by ſurrender, it ſhould have been revived.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is clear, that if a Chattell perſonall be ſuſpended by Sute, it ſhall be gone for ever. As if a Feme marries the Obligor. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. unleſs ſuſpenſion be in anothers right; if it be by the act of the party, there it ſhall be revived: As if a Feme Executrix marry with the Obligor, and he dyes, the ſuſpenſion is determined, and they are revived againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. In one <hi>Gaſcoines</hi> Caſe. Leſſee ſurrenders to the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, upon condition the rent be ſuſpended; but if the Leſſor enter, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions broken, the Rent is revived. Which in effect is our caſe. A rent is granted to the Daughter, and the land deſcends to her and her other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who make partition. The Rent is revived: for it is the joynt act of both parties. <hi>Plow.</hi> 15. If a man had a Rent, and diſſeiſes the Tenant of the land, and after the Diſſeiſee re-enters. Where there is a revivor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49570:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the land, there is a revivor of the Rent; for the diſſeiſin was the cauſe of the ſuſpenſion, and that now is gone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe that when the Leſſee for years ſurrenders, the term is determined to all purpoſes, and the Leſsor is in of his Eſtate is Fee; and there is a diverſity of ſurrender in reſpect of a ſtranger; for to a ſtranger it may have Eſsence after ſurrender. But as to himſelf it is otherwiſe extinct. And he cannot ſay that it had any Eſsence. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 12. But in reſpect of a ſtranger it ha's continuance, as if an Executor ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet it ſhall be aſsets. And all acts done upon Leſsee for ltfe before ſurrender, ſhall have a continuance after. And ſo he prayed Iudgement for the Avowant. But more after.</p>

And <hi>Stamford</hi> brought a <hi>Scire fac,</hi> againſt <hi>Cooper</hi> (to wit now) becauſe he ought not to have the land by <hi>Elegit.</hi> And the Queſtion was, whether the Iudgement by relation ſhall defeat the Statute. And it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the Iudgement ſhall have relation to the Eſsoin day, which is the 20 day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> for that is the firſt day of the term legally; and the fourth day after is the firſt day of the Term open. <hi>Dyer</hi> 361. <hi>Pla.</hi> 10.

If a man be obliged to pay money the firſt day of the Term, he ſhall not pay it but upon the fourth day after, for that is the firſt day in all common acceptance.

A Iudgement was given the 20 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and a Releaſe of all Errours the 21 <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and adjudged that that bars the Iudgement given the 20 <hi>Ianuary;</hi> although it was not entred the fourth day after. A Iuſtice in the Kings Bench examined an Infant upon inſpection the Eſsoin day, and found him to be under age and would not permit him to confeſs a Iudgement, although that he would have come to full age the fourth day after. The Court agreed that one may be non-ſuited the Eſsoyn day; and if he confeſs an Action that day, it ſhall be good. And thereupon Iudgement was given that by the relation, the Statute ſhould be avoided, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>AN Annuity was brought by <hi>Gerrard</hi> againſt the Parſon of <hi>B.</hi> And the Plaintiff counts, That the ſaid Parſon granted an Annuity of 40 l. <hi>pro bono conſilio ſuo impoſter. impenſo,</hi> for term of life of the ſaid Parſon. And for 30 l. of arrerages this Action was brought. <hi>Finch,</hi> thought the Count not to be good. And firſt it is to be conſidered, If that Annuity might be aſsigned and granted over or not. And as I think it cannot. For an Annuity is not but as a ſum of mony, to be paid to the Grantee by the Grantor. And not at all to the realty, if the Land be not charged by expreſs words in the ſame Deed. And to prove it, If a man grant an Annuity to me and my Heirs, without naming of my Heirs; If the Annuity be denied, it is gone; Becauſe my Perſon is only charged with the Annuity, and not the Land. So if a man grants to you the Stewardſhip of his Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and to your Heirs, you cannot grant that over. And ſo of a Bayliwick. But peradventure it may be ſaid, That an Annuity may be granted over in this Caſe. Becauſe in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> It is ſaid to the Aſsignees of the Grantee. But that is nothing to the purpoſe, as I think. For I take a difference when a thing comes in the <hi>Habendum</hi> of a Deed, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Premiſes of the Deed; For there it ſhall be taken effectuall, but otherwiſe not. As if Lands be given to a man and his Heirs <hi>haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſibi &amp; haered de corpore ſuo procreat.</hi> That is a good tayl. But if a thing comes in the <hi>Habend.</hi> which is repugnant to the Premiſes of the Deed, and to the matter of the thing which is given by the Deed, Then the <hi>Habend.</hi> is void for that parcel. As in the Caſe at Bar, it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the nature of the Annuity to be aſsigned over to another. And there is no remedy given for it but an Action, and it is Common learning, that a thing in Action cannot be aſsigned over unleſs it be by the grant of the King. Alſo by their Declaration, they have acknowledged it to be no more than a <hi>choſe in action.</hi> Then a Rent ſeck for which he had not any other remedy but an Action after Seiſin.

And it was ſaid, That that Remainder might commence upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition well enough. It was ſaid by <hi>Atthowe,</hi> That where a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der depends upon a determination of another Eſtate, So that none ſhall take any Eſtate by the Remainder upon Condition, then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is good. As if a man give Lands to <hi>A.</hi> for life, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if <hi>I. S.</hi> pay me 40 s. before ſuch a day: That the Remainder ſhall be to him; That is a good Remainder. But when an Eſtate is to be defeated by a Remainder depending upon that, Then the Remainder is not good. As if I leaſe Lands for life, upon Condition, That if the Rent be in arrear that the Remainder ſhall be to a Stranger, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is not good. <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, that in my opinion my Brother <hi>Atthow</hi> ſpoke well, and ſo it was affirmed.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49570:51"/> not paſs. Part of the Evidence was, That the Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> being ſeiſed of the Lands in Queſtion, makes a Leaſe of them by words of Demiſe, Bargain, and Sale to Iudge <hi>Crook</hi> for a Month, to begin the 29 <hi>September, habendum a datu,</hi> and it was deliveted the 3 of <hi>September.</hi> And the ſame day he bargains and ſells the Reverſion. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Becauſe that no Entry appears by the Leſſees by vertue of the Demiſe, he ſubmitted to the Court, If there was any ſuch Reverſion in the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he bring in poſſeſsion, And this difference was a greed; That if one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes Lands for years, and Grants the Reverſion before Entry of the Leſſée. The Grant is void. As it is in <hi>Saffins</hi> Caſe. <hi>Cook</hi> 5. 12. 46. But if a man bargain and ſell for years, and grants the Reverſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Entry of the Leſſee, it is good. For the Statute transfers the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion to the uſe. As if a man bargain and ſells in fee or for life, and the Deed is inrolled. The Bargainee is in poſſeſsion of the Frank-tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo it is of a Leaſe for years which is a Chattell. And by <hi>Crook,</hi> In the Court of Wards that very point was reſolved. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> Alſo there are words of Demiſe, and Bargain, and Sale, before which the Leſſee had his Election to take by which he would. As Sir <hi>Rowland Heyards</hi> Caſe is. But by <hi>Hutton,</hi> and it was not denyed. He ſhould be in by the Bargain and Sale before Election; For that is more for his advantage. Further the Evidence was, That <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> made a Leaſe of thoſe Lands which were a Mannor, And makes a Conveyance from himſelf for life with divers Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and then to the uſe of the Daughter or Daughters of the ſaid <hi>George.</hi> And the heirs males of thrir bodies the remainder to the heirs of the body of the ſaid <hi>George,</hi> &amp;c. and had 3 Daughters to whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. The firſt dyed without Iſſue the, 2 d. dyed having Iſſue male, the 3 d. bargains &amp; ſells all her half part, and pur part to <hi>Edw.</hi> Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> Who now being ſeiſed of a third part of the Eſtate of Inheritance, and of the other two parts for his life, and the lives of the 3 Daughters, ſuffers a common recovery by the name of the moyety of the Mannor. And the doubt was, what paſſed. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> By that there is not paſſed but the moyety of the third part. <hi>Hutton, Crook,</hi> and <hi>Yei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> were on the contrary opinion, and ſaid that by that, All the third part paſſed alſo. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> If a man be ſeiſed of the mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> and buys half for life of another in fee, and makes a Feoffment of the half of the Mannor; The moyety which he had in Fee ſhall paſs. And there ſhall be a forfeiture for no part. Which was agreed by the Court. If a man be ſeiſed of the third part, and grants the moyety, perhaps the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the third part only paſſes. But he is ſeiſed of all. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> There are ſeveral Eſtates, and moyety goes to that Eſtate which he had in the Mannor. For when I grant more than I can grant, that which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſſes. <hi>Crook</hi> I had the third part of a Mannor, and grant the moyety of the Mannor; all my third part paſſes. But in the Bargain and Sale, the words were <hi>part et pur part.</hi> Which as it was paſſed all. And alſo the Covenant to the Leſſor; The Recovery was of the <hi>half part &amp; pur part.</hi> And by <hi>Hutton, Crook, Yelverton,</hi> All was intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, And then the word Moyety carries that tresbien. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> That Indentures of Covenant much mends the Caſe. Another Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Evidence was, Whether when a Bargain and ſale is made of Lands; And the Bargainee before inrollment makes a Leaſe for years, and afterwards it is enrolled. If the Leaſe now be good. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardſon</hi> and <hi>Yelverton,</hi> It ſhall be, that although it be after acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, and before inrollment, yet it is naught. And by <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> it was ſo adjudged in <hi>Bellingham</hi> and <hi>Hortons</hi> Caſe; That if one ſells in fee, and before inrollment, the Bargainee bargains and ſells to another; And afterwards comes an Inrollment.

Vaughan</hi> at the day <hi>quod Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Vaughan</hi> was ſeiſed of the place, <hi>quo, &amp;c.</hi> And being ſeiſed the 9th of <hi>Maii,</hi> 10 <hi>Iac.</hi> by Indenture granted to <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> a Rent of twenty Nobles <hi>per annum</hi> out of the place <hi>in quo, &amp;c.</hi> to commence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Anne Vaugham,</hi> for life, payable at the Feaſts of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and the Annunciation. And if the Rent be in Arrear at any day of payment, or fourteen daies after the demand at a place out of the Land, <hi>ſcil.</hi> his Capital Meſſuage in <hi>Orleton;</hi> Then it ſhould be lawfull for him to diſtrein; And he ſhews that twenty Marks were in arrear. And that 22 <hi>Iac.</hi> 22 <hi>Octob.</hi> He demands it at <hi>Orleton,</hi> &amp;c. And the Plea in Bar was, That the Grantor was not <hi>compos mentis</hi> at the time. Vpon which Iſſue was taken. But it appeared upon the evidence that at the time of the Grant <hi>Gaudebat lucido intervallo.</hi> Whereupon it was found for the Defendant. And Sergeant <hi>Barkley</hi> moved in arreſt of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For that the Demand appears to be after the 14 daies. And he took a difference where the Demand ought to be made upon the Land, But there it may be demanded at any time. And the Diſtreſs it ſelf is a Demand. As it was adjudged 20 <hi>Iac.</hi> in <hi>Skinners</hi> Caſe. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ought to be out of the Land. <hi>Henden</hi> objected, becauſe the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue was joyned, That cannot be ſhewed. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> Although there was Iſſue joyned; Yet it appears that you cannot diſtreyn without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: if there be not actual demand of the Diſtreſs alleged; It is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. And for the matter he cited <hi>Maunds</hi> Caſe, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 28. And he doubted if ſuch a difference would hold, <hi>Berkley,</hi> This difference was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me before cited. But <hi>lecto recordo</hi> the Demand is not <hi>ex tunc pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tito.</hi> But if it be in arrear, and required at the Capital Meſſuage, upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49570:53"/> which he demanded, it does not refer to any place. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> If there be a <hi>nomine poenae,</hi> then it ought to be demanded ſtrictly at a day. And when it is to be demanded upon the Land, it may be at any time. For that, that <hi>Littleton</hi> ſayes, That a Tenant is intended alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon the Land; But when the Demand is to be made at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, it is only to give notice, and ſo it is demandable upon the Land. <hi>Hutton,</hi> by that expoſition if he does not hit the demand upon the day, he ſhall loſe his Rent. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> He had loſt his Diſtreſs by that day only, but not his Rent; For if he demand it after upon the Land, he may have an Aſsiſe. <hi>Hutton,</hi> you would make that partly a Rent-ſeck and partly a Rent-charge. <hi>Harvey,</hi> If the Rent be not gone, but that he may have an aſsiſe. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> It is a Rent-charge generally by the clauſe of the diſtreſs. And for that he may have an Aſsiſe, which is a remedy for a Rent-charge as well as a Diſtreſs. <hi>Hutton,</hi> If you may make it a Rent-ſeck, you have loſt the Rent-charge for ever. If a Grantee of a Rent-charge or Rent-ſeck brought an annuity. <hi>Richardſon.</hi> If he proceed to Declaration he had loſt the Rent-charge. <hi>Et adjournatur.</hi>

Where it was ruled, if the Spiritual Court will not allow that plea which is good in our Law, a Prohibition ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in Caſe of Tithes. And he ſaid that the Caſe of a Legacy is all one. <hi>Crook,</hi> When one comes to diſcharge a thing by due matter of Law, and proves it by one Witneſs, If it be not allowed, no Prohibition ſhall be granted there. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> Our Caſe is proof of <hi>plene.

But if there be enough pleaded, which goes in diſcharge, and proves that by one Witneſs, and not allowed; A Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſhall be granted. <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, that properly for a Legacy the ſute is in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, although they may ſue in the Chancery for it; yet the proper Court is the Eccleſiaſtical Court; And they ſaid, they uſed to allow one Witneſs with other good circumſtantial proofs. If they be not in ſome criminal Cauſes, where of neceſsity there muſt be two Witneſſes. In one <hi>Hawkins</hi> Caſe. Farm or of a Propriation, libells for Tithes of Lambs for ſeven years: And there he proved payment by one Witneſs; and a Prohibition was granted for not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> There may be a difference where the Sute is meerly Eccleſiaſticall for a ſum of mony; as for a Legacy there the payment of the legacy is of the nature of the thing. And the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court ſhall have Iuriſdiction of the proof and matter. But if one gives a legacy of 20 Oxen; And the other pleads payment of as much mony in ſatisfaction, there they cannot proceed, but upon Common law; For that that the legacy is altered. And if a proof of one Witneſs is not accepted, a Prohibition ſhall be granted. For now it is a legal Tryall. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6 If the principal is proper for their Court, the acceſſory is of the ſame nature. Alſo the Sute is commenced for a Legacy: and the other

For they ſometimes take that for Aſſets, which our Law does not take. It was adjudged in the Kings Bench, that a proof by one Witneſs of a Releaſe of a Legacy was diſallowed, a Prohibition ſhall be granted. <hi>Crook,</hi> In this Caſe a proof of ſetting out of Tithes by one Witneſs a Prohibition ſhall be granted.</p>

In a Prohibition, the Libel was for Wood imployed in Hedging, and for Fire-wood.

                  <p>
                     <hi>BIbble</hi> brought an Action upon the Caſe againſt <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That there was a Communication between him and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant of the ſale of a Banck, and an acre of Land. And that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof, and that the Plaintiff would aſſure and deliver to the Defendant poſſeſsion of all the Banck aſſoon as he could; and that at all times upon requeſt to be made to the Plaintiff by the Defendant, the Plaintiff would become bound in a Statute Merchant to make the Aſſurance to the Defendant; The Defendant promiſed to pay to the Plaintiff 72 l. at the end of 3 years from Michaelmas next enſuing. And that in the mean time for the forbearance he would give after 8 l. in the 100 l. and that he became bound in a Statute Merchant for the payment of 72 l. And he alleges that the Defendant did not become bound in the Statute; but that he himſelf delivered poſſeſsion as ſoon as he could. And upon <hi>non-aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, it was found for the Plaintiff. And <hi>Atthowe</hi> moved in Arreſt of Iudgement; It is not a good conſideration or promiſe. He ſaid that there was a <hi>Colloquium</hi> and an Agreement, and in Conſideration thereof, &amp;c. That is not a good Conſideration. And the ſecond Conſideration that he delivered, &amp;c. <hi>tam citius quam potuit;</hi> It is not good, for it is uncertain. For it may be a year, or two years, or a day after. And the other promiſe to pay 8 l. in the hundred <hi>deferendo diem,</hi> And there is not any deferring the day; for it is not ſhewn that it is due before, and that he ſhall be bound in a Statute, and that no ſum is expreſſed which is uncertain. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> There is a good Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a good promiſe. There was an Agreement touching the ſale of a Banck, and an acre of Land: and take all alike, and that perfects the Agreement. And it is plain that the Agreement was for 72 l. and the delivery of the poſſeſsion, or making of aſſurance, is not any Conſideration. But the promiſe is all the Conſideration. And he might have omitted the averment of the delivery of the poſſeſsion. But there is a croſs and mutual promiſe upon which the Action might lye. As many times it had been adjudged in this Court, and in the Kings Bench. And for the words <hi>tam ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quam potuit,</hi> the Law appoints the time <hi>(ſcilicet)</hi> ſo ſoon as he can go &amp; remove his goods &amp; things out of the Houſe, &amp;c. As in Caſe, where one ſels goods for mony the Vendee ſhall have for telling the mony. And ſo here at the moſt, till requeſt be made. And although it is not expreſſed in what ſum he ſhall be bound by the Statute, Yet it appears, that it is for the payment of 72 l. And then the ſum ought to be double in which he is bound. As if one arbitrate that he pay 72 l. and enters into an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the payment of it. That ſhall be in the double ſum. In which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49570:55"/> Caſe he ſaid, that he could ſhew ſeveral Iudgements of it. <hi>Crook,</hi> If one promiſe to me divers things, ſome of which are certain; It is good. But alſo for the time of the delivery, there the Law adjudges of that; And the ſum of the Statute ſhall be double, as it had been ſaid. But for the Caſe of the Arbitrament, it is adjudged contrary; as 5 <hi>Salmons</hi> Caſe. And admit that it be uncertain, It is a reciprocal <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> and an Action will lye upon that. <hi>Hutton,</hi> If a promiſe to enter into an Obligation, there ought to be a reaſonable ſum, as the Caſe requires for it. And in this Caſe it being in a Statute, which is more penal than an Obligation, I conceive the ſame ſum of 72 l. will ſerve. And for the time of the delivery of the poſſeſsion; It ought to be in convenient time, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requeſt. As 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. And the Law adjudges of the inconveniences of time. And although that he fails in the ſum of his promiſes, the end of his promiſe is good enough; and the other is not concluded by that Action. But he might allege other conſiderations, in actions brought by him. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> There is but one promiſe againſt another; And the ſum in the Statute ought to be the ſame ſum. As the Caſe where an Annuity is granted of 20 l. untill the Grantee be advanced to a benefice; That ought to be a benefice of the ſame value. But I doubt whether it ſhould be double. <hi>Harvey,</hi> It is there by way of promiſe. And then one promiſe is the conſideration of another, and there is no breach, for it ought to be upon requeſt. And then the Action being brought upon that ſide, the requeſt cannot be alleged: and one promiſe good againſt another. Then be the ſum what it will, ought the Defendant to be bound ſingle or double? The <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> not being performed, all agreed that the Action well lies.</p>

And if that Rent is granted by one Deed, and the diſtreſs upon the Land by another Deed, If it be not delivered at the ſame time, then there ſhall be a Rent-charge, and there ſhall be alſo a Rent-ſeck. And when alſo it is ſaid, that <hi>ulterius</hi> he grants <hi>per ſcriptum ſuum,</hi> and does not ſay <hi>praedict.</hi> It ſhall be intended another Deed then, without averment, that it was delivered at the ſame time, It ſhall be intended at another time. But admit that it be a Rent-charge, and that it iſſue out of <hi>Ollerton</hi> where the demand of it was; Yet he ought to maintain that actually. In <hi>Maunds</hi> Caſe. The diſtreſs is a ſufficient demand; For it is not but to inable him to deſtreyn, and that is where the demand is limitted generally. But if a Rent be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if it be demanded of the perſon of the Gruntor, he may deſtreyn; Then there may be an actual demand, that was adjudged. As in the Court, 15 <hi>Jac. Com. Banc. Iackſon</hi> and <hi>Langfords</hi> Caſe, and in one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merys</hi> Caſe. And in another upon the ſame point. So if you will grant a Rent-charge demandable at a ſpecial and particular place; If it was at another place than the Land charged, Without doubt there ought to be an actual demand. So if it be upon a ſpecial place from the Land char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or demanded; for the diſtreſs ought to be purſued as the Grant is. And that is upon ſuch a demand. But where it is reſtrained by the words of the Grant. And the ſame Law is where you will limit the time of the demand; If the Rent be granted payable at ſuch a day, and grants over that <hi>ad tunc</hi> being demanded: there a legal and general demand will not ſerve; But there ought to be an actual demand; And alſo it is as much although not in expreſs words; for the ſence and meaning carries it. If it be arrear at ſuch a day <hi>exiſtent. petit.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ought to be at the day mentioned before. If I be bound in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, the Condition to pay mony at ſuch a day, being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; There ought to be a demand at the day of payment, or there ſhall not be a forfeiture. And now then there is not a demand at the time, ſo no cauſe of diſtreſs. And although the Verdict be found, if it be collateral matter, yet it will not help. For when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears upon the whole matter, that there is not any Title to diſtreyn; the Tryall will not help it. And ſo Iudgement ſhall be given for the Plaintiff. <hi>Hutton, Harvy</hi> and <hi>Yelverton</hi> agreed, That if it was a Rent-ſeck, and the diſtreſs a penalty, there ought to be an actuall demand at the time limited. But in caſe of a Rent-charge, although the demand is limited to be made upon parcell, Yet they all held, that a generall demand will ſerve; And that ſhall be at any place, at any time. For <hi>Harvey</hi> ſaid, There is no oddes whether it is limited to be demanded generally, or to be demanded upon <hi>Dale.</hi> If it be material, it ought to be obſerved in the one Caſe as well as in the other.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Parſon libels for the tithes of young Cattel preſerved for the Cart. And the Queſtion was as before, Whether in ſuch Caſes a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ought to be ſurmiſed. And <hi>Crook, Fitz-Herberts nat. brev.</hi> is, That of right Tithes ſhall not be paid for ſuch things. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> In all ſuch Caſes the Parſon ought not to have Tithes, if there be not a Cuſtome alleged, by which the Parſon had any thing, or recompence, or by which his other Tithe is better. And he ſaid, that he had ſearched the Books, and the Book of Entries, And there is not any ſuch Caſe, but ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, as for that, that he had tithe of Corn in <hi>ſpecie</hi> where the Land is incloſed; And ſo the Corn better. <hi>Hutton,</hi> It ought to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the thing in his nature be tithable, or if there be any uſage to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it or not, as the Cattel are in their nature titheable, then you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prohibit it; But the uſage ought to be ſurmiſed ſo. And it may be Law, as the Parſon had better tithes. <hi>Harvey,</hi> If a Libell be for tithes of Hedgeing and Fenceing; there a ſurmiſe ought to be made to diſcharge that. But when it is for tithes of Heyfars, which in apparency ought to be ſpared by the Law of the Land, Otherwiſe it is, &amp;c. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> For the herbage of thoſe Heyfars, tithe is due by the Eccleſiaſticall law. And we never can take tithe of them without expreſs cuſtome or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. <hi>Harvey,</hi> There was a Caſe 16 <hi>Jac. Com. Banc.</hi> A Parſon ſues for the herbage of Horſes, and the other alleged, that he kept them for the carrying of Coals. There he ought to ſurmiſe ſomething to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49570:57"/> diſcharged; And if he allege that he kept them in his houſe for ſerving of Husbandry; the other may allege that he kept them to carry Coals, and the allegation is traverſable. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> There was a caſe, where the queſtion was, <hi>A</hi> Husbandman keeps an Horſe to ride up and down about his buſineſs; whether he ſhall pay for the herbage of him. And a prohibition in that caſe was granted; But a ſurmiſe ought to be made. <hi>Crook</hi> ſaid, that in the Kings Bench he had 20 times ſeen a prohibition granted in ſuch caſes, without any ſurmiſe. And a libel is for dry Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; If it be alleged that they are kept for the Plough, the other may allege that he keeps them to ſell, without that, that he keeps them for the plough. And before there is any profit of them, it is not reaſon they ſhould be tithable, and the Parſon ſhall have the benefit for them after. And for hedging it is <hi>lex terrae</hi> that he ſhall pay no tithes. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> It is <hi>lex terrae ne conſuetudo loci facit legem terrae.</hi> And if he had uſed to pay tithes for the Cattel or for hedging, he ought not to pay that ſtill. If an ignorant man will pay tithes for thoſe things, and after upon a livell a prohibition is granted; if the other does not allege a cuſtom, the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſtand; or if they allege a cuſtom, which is found againſt him, no conſultation ſhall be granted And for a Garden penny, the reaſon of that is apparent: for otherwiſe tithes ſhall be paid in ſpecie: And ſo for Harth-penny, if he had always paid it, it ought to be paid. <hi>Hutton,</hi> If a man had an antient garden for which he paid a penny, and that is inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, of that inlargement tithes ought to be paid in <hi>ſpecie.</hi>

                  <p>IN a prohibition for ſlanderous words. <hi>Brampſton</hi> ſhewed cauſe why a prohibition ſhould not iſſue.

Becauſe that the Plaintiff might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his proceſſe againſt the Defendant. But if it be upon Execution after Iudgement; Now an action does not lye againſt the party, but againſt the Sheriff: And if he had an action againſt the party, he ſhall have an action againſt the Sheriff alſo, and ſo twice ſatisfied. And the Sheriff ſhall have an action againſt the party, and ſo he ſhall be twice charged. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, That the action well lies for the Caſe in 16 <hi>E.</hi> 4. It is ſéen there, that it is doubted upon the mean proces &amp; execution, as to the reſcous, the party may have an action either againſt the Sheriff or the reſcouſſers. And in ſome caſes a man ſhall have his election of the actions, and both actions are but to recover damages. <hi>A</hi> man had an execution againſt one, He ſaw the man, and conveyed him out of his ſight, And it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an action upon the caſe lies againſt him. And peradventure the Sheriff is dead, then he ſhould have no remedy, if he had not an action againſt the party, and no inconvenience follow; For he that will do ſuch a wrong, it is no matter if he be charged by both. If the Sheriff ſuffer one to eſcape, it is an eſcape as to the Sheriff; but the Plaintiff may have a new execution againſt the party if he will, as it was reſolved in this Court; but <hi>Hutton</hi> on the contrary, and that the action does not lie. As if a man be impriſoned, and an other help him out of priſon; yet an action will not lie againſt him by the Plaintiff; And the difference is good, where a man is arreſted upon a mean proceſſe, and reſcued, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards becomes <hi>non ſolvend.</hi> ſo that they who reſcued him is the cauſe of the loſs of my debt; It is a wrong upon which he may be indicted. Yet the party ſhall not have a remedy againſt him, becauſe that he may proceed. And then he ſhould be the cauſe of multiplicity of actions. <hi>Yelverton</hi> was of the ſame opinion, and agreed that difference put before. And that there is no difference between this caſe, and the caſe put by <hi>Hutton.</hi> For a reſcous made half an hour after the arreſt is all one as if it were a year after. And <hi>Fitzherb. nat. brev.</hi> 102. ſatisfies me. <hi>Harvey</hi> on the contrary, He who was injured, the law gives him a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the party who did the wrong. In the Kings Bench, the caſe how one came to take in execution by a <hi>fier. fac.</hi> the goods being in an houſe, and one ſéeing the Sheriff came and ſhut cloſe the door, and adjudged that an action upon the caſe lies againſt him. And there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our caſe and that, where one comes to make execution, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes a reſcous. <hi>Richardſon</hi> in <hi>Greſhams</hi> caſe; <hi>Greſham</hi> was poſſeſſor of the glaſſe houſe at <hi>Black-fryars. Beresford</hi> was a Glaſs-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and had many glaſſes in <hi>Greſhams</hi> houſe. <hi>Seaman</hi> recovers in debt againſt <hi>Beresford,</hi> and coming to make Execution of thoſe glaſſes, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> ſtanding at his door, ſéeing them coming, and knowing their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhut the doors. <hi>Seaman</hi> brought an action upon the caſe againſt him, and judgement was given for the Defendant, becauſe that the Sheriff never demanded the Key to open the houſe, 18 <hi>E.</hi> 2. If he had demanded the Key, it had been adjudged againſt <hi>Greſham.</hi> And there if an action upon the caſe will lie for hindring to make execution, <hi>a multo fortiori,</hi> when it is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, and then the party reſcued. And he denied the caſe put by <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where one is reſcued out of priſon. And ſaid, if one be reſcued from the Bayliffs, the Sheriff ought to have the action. <hi>Hutton</hi> upon a mean proceſs, the Sheriff never had remedy for the reſcous, but he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the reſcous. But upon an execution, he ſhall not return the reſcous, but he ſhall have an action, and that the party is not prejudiced; for he ſhall have an action againſt the Sheriff, who in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of law is the party lyable. <hi>Crook,</hi> That the action will lie is a miſchief on both parts. The Defendant may be twice charged, and the Plaintiff may loſe his Debt. But I conceive the action well lies againſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49570:59"/> him who made the reſcous, &amp;c. And if the Sheriff brings the action he may plead the recovery by the Plaintiff; when the Sheriff makes his return of the reſcous, there is no remedy againſt him, as it was adjudged; And the difference is, that when he goes to make execution, it is at his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril if he does not take power enough with him, ſo that he may do it. And if the Gaol be broken, it is no excuſe for the Sheriff. Alſo if the party taken before he come to the Gaol is reſcued, there is no remedy againſt the executors of the Sheriff. If debt be brought againſt the Sheriff for an eſcape, and in that a recovery, the Plaintiff ſhall never take the party again: And ſo alſo if he brought an action againſt the party, and recovered, the Sheriff may plead that. And for the book in <hi>Fitzh. Nat. brev.</hi> cited, it remains doubtfull. <hi>Hutton,</hi> a Stranger commits waſte, and the Leſſee dies, yet no remedy againſt the party who committed the waſte; for the Leſſee is charged of waſte. And ſo alſo the Sheriff of an eſcape. But after, as it was told me by one who was preſent, Iudgement was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

                  <p>IN evidence to the Iury betwéen <hi>Robert Allen,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Weſtley,</hi> upon the 5. <hi>Eliz</hi> for perjury: <hi>Richardſon</hi> there remembred, that there was one charged with perjury, and it was layed; that one ſwore that he drew his dagger, and beat and wounded another; And it was found to be with a ſtaff; and it was agréed not to be perjury; for the beating was only material. It was one <hi>Styles's</hi> his caſe; and it was agréed by the Court in that caſe, that although a witneſs ſwears the truth; yet if it be not truth of his own knowledge, as if he ſhews how one revoked a will by paroll, in his hearing, when the words were ſpoken to another in his abſence, he does not ſwear truly, and it is a corrupt oath within the Statute. And it appears in the caſe in which this perjury was ſuppoſed to be committed, which was between <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Weſtley;</hi> alſo that theſe words were good words of revocation of a will. <hi>I utterly renounce and deteſt that Will, and will make a new one;</hi> But if they were, <hi>That Will ſhall not ſtand, I will make a new one,</hi> they are not; For the firſt ſhews a preſent purpoſe of revocation, the laſt a <hi>fortiori;</hi> but more afterwards.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>DAvenport</hi> argued for the Plaintiff. And the Queſtion here is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any Eſtate in <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Walter</hi> ſetled at the time of the Fine levyed? Or their Eſtate was only in contingency? Becauſe that <hi>Richard</hi> was then living. For I agrée, that if at the time of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49570:60"/> Fine levyed, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Walter</hi> had not any Eſtate ſetled or veſted but all in contingency, That then the Fine deſtroyed all the Remainders. For it is clear when Tenant for life is, and the Remainder in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency levy a Fine; That is a forfeiture; and deſtroys all the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Remainders. 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 131. I hope that they will agrée, that if there be an Eſtate ſetled in them, that Tenant for life levies that Fine; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they in the Remainder do not enter within 5 years after the death of Tenant, or after the eſtate eſcheated. And that was adjudged 21 <hi>Jac. Tooker &amp; Lawns</hi> Caſe in the Kings Bench. But the Caſe was <hi>Mich.</hi> 33 <hi>&amp;</hi> 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Queſtion then is, whether <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Walter</hi> having any Eſtates ſetled in them, two Eſtates are ſo limited to them joyntly for their lives, ſo long as <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> ſhall have iſſue male of their bodies living.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Eſtate to them was to their own uſe, and that was not joyntly but ſucceſsive. And if any of thoſe uſes were in eſſe at that time of the Fine, then they fall out clearly with the Plaintiff. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that both their Eſtates were in them. Firſt, concerning the firſt Remainder limited to their joynt uſe, in which it is to be conſidered; Where the not ſetting forth of the Lands makes it contingent. It is a ſtrange Caſe. That if the directions for the ſetting out had been obſerved, that then there might have been a preſent Eſtate ſetled upon a ſubſequent Condition, and not upon a precedent Condition. Where it ought to be agréed, when the Indenture is made with a Covenant to levy a Fine, That no uſe will riſe before the Fine. <hi>Coment.</hi> 302. Then although ſome things ought to be done before the uſes will riſe. If thoſe things had been done, the uſe ought to be raiſed. For <hi>certum eſt quod certum reddi poteſt.</hi> 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. When contracts are upon incertainties, when the thing uncertain is become certain; when the Indenture was ſealed, that made a contingent uſe in the limitation, but when the thing had been done, it ſhall make a perfect uſe in the limitation. But now it is become impoſsible by the non-performance, &amp;c. It had been urged that ſo there ſhall be a double contingent, which is concerning the Houſes, &amp;c. I ſay there is a great difference, between a Collateral uſe which does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the other Eſtates, and an Eſtate limited in courſe of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. I agree, if they be contingent Remainders, the Fine will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and overthrow them: but if there be a collateral clauſe by which a uſe is limited; As if there be a Proviſo, that if ſuch mony be not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſhall be to ſuch an uſe; That contingent uſe is not deſtroyed by Fine. 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 130, 134. <hi>Chidleys</hi> Caſe, where the difference is directly taken; If a Feoffment be made to the uſe of the Feoffee for life, with divers contingent Remainders over. If Tenant for life makes a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment, all the contingent Remainders are deſtroyed. But where the contingent came in by a collateral Clauſe, and not by way of Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, otherwiſe it is. As a Feoffment to the uſe of a man and his wife, which ſhall be a Remainder over. That is a good uſe to the wife, and cannot be deſtroyed by feoffment. <hi>Dyer</hi> 274. and <hi>Bracebridges</hi> Caſe cited in <hi>Chudleys</hi> Caſe 133. It was adjudged accordingly. In the third branch here it is; If he dies, then ſhe ſhould have the Houſes during wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood. But the courſe of the Remainder came in the fourth clauſe; And that had relation to the firſt. And as to the ſecond as it is ſhewn: that at the time of the limitation it was not the intent, that the Remainder ſhall be contingent to <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Walter.</hi> If I grant to a man, that if he mary my Daughter, he ſhall have my Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> for years, the mariage ought to be before he ſhall have any thing in the Mannor. But if it had been, that he ſhould have had my Mannor for 7 years, if he mary my Daughter; Then the mariage is conditional ſubſequent, that if he does not mary, I ſhall have my Mannor again. 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 44.

And <hi>ex vi termini</hi> there is a perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate before the if, and the former if is well explained by the laſt; That if there be not iſſue male, then the Eſtate ſhall ceaſe. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 41. A Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its nature is not to precede an Eſtate. As if the Lands be given to a woman for years, <hi>ſi tam diu vixerit.</hi> 35 <hi>Aſſiſe plo.</hi> 14. The Caſe in point of a Remainder, which comes to our Caſe, and conteyns both the parts of that difference. As it is in <hi>Colthurſts</hi> and <hi>Binſhams</hi> Caſe. The Prior and Covent of <hi>Bath</hi> leaſes Land for life, the Remainder to <hi>W. Si ipſe inhabitare et reſidens eſſe velit infra praedict. terram.</hi> And if it ſhall happen that the ſaid <hi>W.</hi> ſhould mary before <hi>H.</hi> Then the Remainder to <hi>P.</hi> And the Queſtion is, whether it is a Condition precedent or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Reſolved, that the ſecond is precedent. For that, that the <hi>(Si)</hi> precedes, and for that makes the Eſtate contingent. But for the other <hi>(Si)</hi> after the Eſtate limited, <hi>Si ipſe inhabitare vellet.</hi> They were the very words of <hi>Mountague</hi> Chief Iuſtice, It cannot be denyed but that it is ſubſequent, and then goes in Defeaſance; and the other ought to ſhew the non-performance of it. And that Caſe is more ſtrong than our Caſe is, For that Eſtate is by way of Livery, not by uſe. For in Caſe of Livery, there he ought to have a time to do the thing. And our Caſe then, he ſhould have for life determinable upon the <hi>(Si)</hi> &amp;c. And that conſtruction of Vſes ſhall be clear by the intent, which appears that there ought to be a preſent Eſtate; Where uſes are by Indenture, if by one conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Intent is fruſtrate; and if by another upheld, That ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>ut res magis valeat, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord <hi>Sturtons</hi> Caſe.

                     <hi>FArrington</hi> brought an information againſt <hi>Kemarre</hi> upon the ſtatute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. for ſelling of Beer for more than the Iuſtices aſſeſt. And upon the iſſue of not-guilty joyned, he had a verdict found for him againſt the Defendant. <hi>Atthow</hi> moved in arreſt of Iudgement, that the Court had not Iurisdiction; for that the Statute 21 <hi>Jacob. cap.</hi> 4. It is enacted, That all informations which may be before the Iuſtices of peace, <hi>niſi prius,</hi> Aſsize, Gaol delivery, Dyer and Terminer, ſhall be before them, and not elſewhere. And he ſaid, that an information for this matter may be before the Iuſtices of Peace, &amp;c. But he argued upon the ſtatute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 17 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap</hi> 11. that they may inquire of Vagabonds, &amp;c. Victuals, and Victuallers, and Inneholders. So that the point is, whether it was an offence within the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For if there be an Information, it is given by expreſs words. But that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute does not ouſt the Iurisdiction of this Court; but the Subject had his Election, until the Statute of 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> which confirms ſuch Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that the queſtion is, whether now Brewers be within the word Victuallers, or Beer within the word Victuals: And I conceive that béer is victuals, and Brewers are Victuallers; which I prove by common experience, and by another Statute. There is no Statute in <hi>England</hi> but make informations againſt Brewers, before the Iuſtices of Peace; And they are all erroneous if they be not within the word Victuallers. For by 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A remedy is only given againſt them by an action of <hi>debt, bill, &amp;c.</hi> in which no protection, Eſſoyn, or wager of Law ſhall be allowed but at the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> Then they ought to be upon that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Crompton</hi> are much deceived; For it is an article of their Charge to enquire of Brewers. But another ſtatute, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. The Brewers are called Victuallers, The words are, <hi>If any Butchers, Brewers, Bakers, Poulterers, Cooks, Coſter-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> &amp;c. conſpire to ſell their Victuals, &amp;c. And what victuals ſhall be ſold by a Brewer but Beer? And there the whole Parliament were miſtaken if Brewers were not Victuallers: And for that he concludes, that becauſe that that offence at the making of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> was puniſhable by Information before the Iuſtices of the Peace. For that by this Statute this Court ſhall not have Iurisdiction. But <hi>Hitcham</hi> on the contrary. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſays; That for offences of Brewers they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by the Courts of the King; That it is meant the four Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is clear. And when one Statute is made which confirms a ſute at the four Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> yet if by a ſecond Statute you will alter that, you ought to have preciſe words: And if you bring that within the word Victual, you abrogate the Statute by general words, againſt the wiſdom of Parliament before, which provided that thoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould not be inquirable in the Country, and then the Statute of little force. <hi>Et loquendum ut Vulgus.</hi> It is improper to ſay, that a Brewer is a Victualler, for they are ſuch who ſell in <hi>ſpecie.</hi> And in the Country if it he inquired, whether it be an Alehouſe, or a Victualling houſe: It is ſaid that this is he who ſells victuals, which is for the ſuſtenance of a man, by the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. you will ſay a Brewer there to be a Victualler; for in every Statute the intention ought to be reſpected. For if it goes to Coſt ermongers, it is more clear in reaſon that Brewers ſhall be within that; and Corn and Beer are the chief things which conſerve a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And for that within. And the Statute extends to them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, for inhauncing the prizes. For they take their Courts to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Courts of the King. For thoſe words were not explained until <hi>Gregories</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 6.

                     <hi>Henden</hi> argued and divided his matter into thrée parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſhewed how that Statute conſiſts upon the Statute upon 23. 33. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And it is clear upon 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. what informations ought to be in thoſe Courts, 7 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> 23. <hi>b.</hi> 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>repeal</hi> 33. Only for a particular thing <hi>(viz.)</hi> of the time to enquire of thoſe Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Iuſtices, and makes them inquirable at the Seſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether the Statute 33. took this thing from 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And he thought it did not: Neither by the intention of the ſcope of the Act, nor by the words. Firſt the intention of the Statute was not to inlarge the power of a Iuſtice of Peace, but to provide that ſome things ſhould be duly executed. Which appears firſt by the Title, and then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble. And if they have not particular Statutes, they cannot meddle with that by the general words: By which it follows, that they had not power for Victuallers. Now the 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. provides that Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſhall be ſold, and at what prices: then when that Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. came within 8 years, certainly there was a reſpect to that; And the Statute before concerning Victualls only is, that Victuallers might contain Brewers. For to ſay generally, that Victuallers ſhould be Brewers, ſhall be abſurd. 8 <hi>Rep. Bonhams</hi> Caſe. A Brewer is a Trade, and may be intended under general words: But it ſhall be alwaies <hi>ſecundum ſubjectam materiam.</hi> As ſome Statutes which puniſh the ſelling of Victuals at anj unreaſonable rate, and Beer there is not Victual. And by 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. There is not an expreſs name of a Brewer. Which imports, that it was not contained within the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral word Victualler. 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. Where there is a Common price for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things to be ſold at reaſonable prices; Where Brewers, &amp;c. are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Hoſtlers, Brewers, and other Victuallers, &amp;c. Then theſe Statutes prove that you ought to have Brewers expreſly named; If you will have them taken as Victuallers. But <hi>(poſito)</hi> that Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are within the general words of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. yet the power of this Court is not taken away by the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> In the Kings Bench. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was upon the Statute of Vſury, which was inquirable before the Iuſtices of Peace, at the time of the making of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> And the Queſtion was, Whether Informations are taken by 22 <hi>Iac.</hi> in Caſe of Vſury from the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And adjudged that they were not. Becauſe that it is expreſly limited to thoſe Courts in a branch of the Statute of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. In one <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> it is plain, that Affirmative words cannot take that from thoſe Courts at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> For thoſe are excepted by the Law; If this Statute extends to take the power given to another Law, you will repeal former Statutes without expreſs words. And there is a good rule, take 18 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 247. <hi>pl.</hi> 12. which ſee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It ought to have been pleaded, For to deprive the Court of Iurisdiction; A motion does not ſtand with the intention of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute or the dignity of the Court. For, becauſe the Court had a general Iuriſdiction, it cannot be ouſted of that without pleading upon 31 <hi>Eliz. Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that this Caſe is upon conſideration of 3 Statutes. 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. By the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> Where the Iuſtices of the Peace had ſome power upon Informations; There Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> are bound up. For that, he ſaid to <hi>Henden,</hi> That he did not well underſtand him in his ſecond point But he ſaid I hold; That if that Court only from the time of the making of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> had power; Then it is clear, that it ſo remains now. But if this Court had the ſole power, Then the ſame Informations may be ſo either before the Iuſtices of the Peace, or of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi> Then the Iurisdiction of this Court is ouſted by 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> For the words are in that, plain; It was not the

But that the Statute ought to favour; For when ſuch perſons were ſubject to many informations, they would be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: So that all the queſtion will be upon the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

                  <p>Firſt then if they are within the words, which is proved by the Statute 23 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. which Statute confounds Victuallers, and ſellers of Victuals and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Which ſays preciſely, <hi>that Beer-brewers and Bakers which have been Victuallers,</hi> But whether they are Victuallers within the intention of the Statute, is the doubt. They may be within ſome Statute of Victuallers, and not within others. For if he brew their beer unwholſomly, he may be puniſh'd, but not by Information. And it was well obſerved that the words; That they ought to put in execution certain Laws, which ought to be intended, ſuch in which they had Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction before. It was ſaid that Brewers are not like to a Graſter, Butcher, or Miller, for they prepare that which is made Victuals by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but beer is beer in the hands of the Brewer immediately, and nothing is done to it afterwards to make it more beer. But a Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er although he be a victualler in general; yet not being particularly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he is not within the power of a Iuſtice of peace. Butcher, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and by the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. Vintners are Victuallers, and are theſe within this Statute? Certainly not. But becauſe that Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are named, there ought to be other words; And there are Alehouſe-kéepers and Cooks; For all ſellers of victuals are not within that Law, nor Brewer, nor Baker, which are particular trades of themſelves. And if it had béen intended that they ſhould have béen within the Statute, the Law would have named them. And <hi>Crompton</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> naming Brewers in their charge, is by the Common Law: For that, that for the unwholſomneſs of their Beer in their Aſsize, they are inquirable by preſentment. But by that it does not follow, that a Iuſtice of peace may take information of them. Now the queſtion is upon 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, Brewers are Victuallers. There is one Statute which enacts, that no Mayor ſhall be a Victualler, And afterwards there is another Statute made, that he may be a Mayor although he was a Victualler; So it was intended that they were Victuallers, for they prepared Victuals. But yet it is not within this Statute; for it appears by the preamble, that he is to enquire of things whereof they had power before, either by the Statute, or by the Common-Law; but it was not the intention to give them other authority. They may enquire of a combination in their prizes, and ſuch things; but not by information. Then when the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute gives power to execute, it does not give power of new things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, &amp;c. <hi>Harvey</hi> argued to the like purpoſe; but ſaid, that the Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Courts ought to be preſerved as much as may. For the true execution of the Law is in theſe Courts. For in the Country, if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former inform againſt his neighbour, he will compound the matter, and ſo the King ſhall loſe his profit of the penal Laws. And ſo the Statute is made as a ſtawking horſe to help a friend. <hi>Crook,</hi> It is true that

Yet that charge did not ſo conclude him, but that he might aver that to be before, to have the benefit of the pardon.

Now for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, there are two clauſes in our caſe. Although it be that the offence was before, and part after pardon, yet we ought to grant a prohibition; for that which was before is involved. 5 <hi>Iac. Conveys</hi> caſe. He and his wife after the death of Sir <hi>Blunt,</hi> were ſued before the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, for that that his wife committed Adultery with Sir <hi>Richard Blunt,</hi> and he himſelf was the Pander. And a prohibition was granted for two cauſes: The one, for that Adultery was not inquirable there, the other, becauſe it was pardoned. And although the word Adultery be in their Commiſsion, yet that does not give them Iurisdiction. They cannot meddle with Alimony was one <hi>Condiths</hi> caſe upon the Canons in 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> Which gives to the Parſon jurisdiction to appoint the Clark of the Church: There was a cuſtom there that the Pariſh ſhould appoint it; and ſeveral Clarks being appointed, they ſet ſeveral Pſalmes in the Church, to the diſturbance of it. And a prohibition was granted to the high Commiſsioners for medling with it. <hi>Richardſon</hi> objected divers things with much earneſtneſs, but ſo apparently contrary to Law, that I have omitted it. <hi>Yelverton</hi> ſaid, ſhe ought not to put in ſecurity to obey the ſentence. For if it be averred that all was before the pardon, then there was no cauſe of ſentence, and if no ſentence, then the prohibition ought to be for all. <hi>Crook,</hi> The ſentence is to pay a fine, and to make ſubmiſsion, and to be impriſoned, until ſhe found ſecurity to obey the ſentence; That is void. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, That they had not any means to make the party to pay the fine, and if ſhe would pay it preſently ſhe might be diſcharged. But by the other Iuſtices the High Commiſsioners, cannot demand the ſine; But they may Eſtreat it into the Exchequer. At another day it was ſaid, Sir <hi>Wil. Chamcer</hi> before the high Commiſsioners was by ſentence fined and impriſoned, and by the opinion of all the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>England,</hi> They may proceed by fine and impriſonment; and his caſe was for Adultery. <hi>Hutton</hi> 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi> It was reſolved that they cannot impoſe a fine, but for Hereſies, Schiſms, and Errours, &amp;c. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> The words of the Statute are, that the high Commiſsioners may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the tenour and effect of the Letters Patents of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Yelverton,</hi> The ſentence is the fine and the penance, and there is the end of the ſentence; and when it is ſaid, ſhe ſhall be impriſoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, &amp;c. That is no part of the ſentence, If it was that ſhe ſhould pay a fine, do pennance, and ſhould be impriſoned three months; Then all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49570:66"/> ſhould be the Sentence. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that they may procéed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other things than Hereſies, and Schiſmes, upon that Statute <hi>de primo.</hi> For there are the words Abuſes, Contempts, Offences, and Enormities. <hi>Hutton,</hi> The words in that Statute ſhall have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition according to the meaning of the firſt intent. It was that they had Authority to puniſh the Biſhops and Prelates for Errors and Schiſms, and the change of Religion. For that that they did not regard the power of the Ordinary. But they had incroached many other things. And if thoſe words include any thing, they might puniſh anything whereof the Gc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court had Authority; As working upon Saints daies. But there was a Caſe of one that was ſentenced there for ſuch a Cauſe. And the Fine eſtreated. And upon Argument in the Exchequer their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings adjudged void. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> The word Enormity contains a thing of leſſer nature; For <hi>quicquid eſt contra regulam et normam Juris</hi> is Enormity. And therefore in Treſpaſs, <hi>quare clauſum fregit, et alia enormia ei intulit.</hi> But <hi>Yelverton,</hi> The word ought to be intended of a grand offence; For ſo in common acceptance it imports. <hi>Harvey,</hi> The Fine being pardoned, all is pardoned. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed by excommunication and not by fine and impriſonment. No more at this time was ſaid in this Caſe.</p>

For the thing that he demanded is enough certain and known. <hi>Crook</hi> on the contrary. For although it appears by the circumſtances, how much of the Rent he demanded, Yet the words are not ſo plain as they ought to be. For if a man makes a Leaſe for years, reſerving ſuch a Rent as the antient Farmor was wont to pay from time to time to this day. When the Leſſor comes upon the Land, and ſays to the Leſſee, Pay me my Rent: that is not ſufficient or good: becauſe it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Terms; And yet it appears by the circumſtances. And when a man pleads a demand, He ſhall ſhew the Leaſe, and the Rent reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſhall ſay, That he demanded <hi>redditum praedictum.</hi> And as I remember it was adjudged very lately; That ſuch a Demand ſhall be certain. <hi>Hutton,</hi> I hold a difference between ſuch things which lye in notice of the perſon to whom the demand is made, and where not. For in a <hi>praecipe quod reddat;</hi> if there be a recovery by default, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant brings a deſceit; and by examination of the Summoners it appears, That they came to the Land, and ſummoned him in the Land, but they do not ſhew to him at what day he ought to appear. So the Leſſee knows well enough that the Rent ought to be paid: for it is certain by the Leaſe, to which he is party and privy. But <hi>Crook</hi> ſaid in the Caſe that <hi>Hutton</hi> put. If the Summoners had read the Writ upon the Land, and had ſummoned him to appear at a day compriſed in the Writ; It had been certain enough. And ſo in this Caſe, if he had read the Indenture upon the Land, and after demanded the Rent, as afore it had been. Without queſtion it appears to me it ſhould be good enough.

                     <hi>FInch Recorder,</hi> ſaid <hi>de comuni jure</hi> for Eſtovers burnt in an houſe, tithes ought not to be paid; by the Common law there was not any tithes paid for wood: And although the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. gives a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49570:67"/> for timber, yet <hi>Underwoods</hi> were diſcharged of tithes. See Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Student 171. It is expreſs that Eſtovers are not tithable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not renewing every year, and it is parcel of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for to deſtroy all the underwoods is waſte. And there is another caſe put, where tithes of wood had not by the cuſtom been paid, neither ought they to be paid in law or conſcience: But that is not to be intended, the conſcience of every particular man. <hi>Dawleys</hi> Caſe was reſolved for the <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 13 <hi>Iac. Banc. Roy.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Dike</hi> for the <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> of the ſame preſcription, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to he good; And ſo is the common experience that a whole County may preſcribe ſo. And the reaſon is for that, that by the Common Law it was not due, but by the conſideration of <hi>Winchelſey Linwood</hi> 104. It was ordained to be paid, For then the prelates imputed a great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that then was, for the negligence of paying tithes, and appointed tithes of wood. And the Commons were deſirous to have the Statute of <hi>ſilva. &amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe explained than the Clergy declares it, For they ſay that they ought not to pay tithes of any wood that is of the growth of 10 years. <hi>Hutton,</hi> Wood is tithable in their nature, and then there may be a cuſtom to diſcharge them. And the caſe of <hi>Harthpenny</hi> cannot be anſwered; for if he ſues for the penny, a prohibition ſhall not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>quod conceſſum fuit. Crook</hi> and <hi>Yelverton.</hi> But of things not titha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tithes of them cannot be ſued, without alleging a cuſtom. <hi>Crooke,</hi> It is known that Harthpenny is good by preſcription: This Caſe is when there is not land belonging to the houſe, ſo that the Parſon is not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his tithes another way. But when there are ten ſervants kept for the maintaining it, Then by the Law of the land it appears, that tithe ought not to be paid; although cuſtom had been alleged it is nothing to the purpoſe, as if a cuſtom is alleged to pay 4 <hi>d.</hi> for every acre in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of tithes, and the verdict finds 3 <hi>d.</hi> no conſultation ſhall be granted. And ſo for wood to fence the ground, or dry cattel to manure the ground: Although cuſtom be alleged there in diſcharge of it, and found againſt the party, yet no conſultation ſhall be granted. <hi>Hutton,</hi> the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage of barren Cattel is tithable, becauſe there is a cuſtom which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges thoſe which are for the Cart. And he ſaid that the Cuſtom only makes that <hi>legem terrae.</hi> And he cited Doctor <hi>Graunts</hi> Caſe.

                     <hi>BRowne</hi> brought an action upon the caſe, upon an aſſumpſit againſt <hi>Hancocke,</hi> and declares, that whereas the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> 16 <hi>Iac.</hi> there were ſome controverſies between <hi>Charls Nichols,</hi> and the Brother of the Defendant, concerning arrerages of rent, and it was deſired that <hi>Nichols</hi> would part with his term. And 19 <hi>l.</hi> and a cloak and a gelding were offered to the leſſee for his term, which he refuſed. Afterwards the Defendant in conſideration that the Plaintiff would labour with <hi>Charles Nichols</hi> to take the offer, and make an end between them; Aſſumed, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Plaintiff undertook for the Defendant, he would perform, and alſo ſave him harmleſſe for any thing that he ſhould doe in that buſineſſe: and then he ſaid that he procured <hi>Charles Nichols</hi> to aſsign his term, and to accept the cloak and gelding, which the Defendant did not perform, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49570:68"/> allſo that the Plaintiff covenanted with <hi>Charles Nichols</hi> to perform the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and obliged himſelf to that in 50 <hi>l.</hi> And that afterwards <hi>Charles Nichols</hi> filed a bill of debt for the money, whereupon he compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to pay it, and upon <hi>non aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded it was found for the Plaintiff, and three things were moved in arreſt of Iudgement, which <hi>Serjeant Barkely</hi> anſwered. There was a covenant to enter into an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and the Plaintiff ſhews that he entred before; So he does not perform the conſideration, which he conceived to be a good performance. For if a man be bound to doe an act, or pay money at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> a payment before is good. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. 2. <hi>paſc.</hi> It is ſhewn that an action of Covenant was brought after; And they ſay, that upon his ſhewing covenant does not lie, but debt: but he ſaid, that the Plaintiff had his election here to have debt or covenant. As in the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> caſe, the words covenanted provided and agreed, give advantage of a condition or covenant. If a covenant had been ſor 30 <hi>l.</hi> then debt only lyes; But here it is to perform an agreement. Thirdly that it appears within the declaration that the action of the caſe was 6 years before the action brought; And ſo by the Statute of 21. <hi>Jac.</hi> the action does not lye. I agree if the cauſe was 6 years before; yet the breach was within the 6 years, and that is the cauſe of action. 6. <hi>rep.</hi> 43. In a covenant, there is the deed, and the breach of the covenant, and that is the cauſe of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; And therefore being matter in Deed, an accord with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a good plea to it. 13. <hi>E.</hi> 4. Attaint is grounded upon matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but the falſe oath is the cauſe of it. For that there alſo, accord is a good plea; So in our caſe, the non performance by default was not at the time limitted, which was before the 6 years: but no action was brought againſt the Plaintiff, untill within the ſix years; And then he is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed untill within the ſix years 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 24. <hi>Richardſon.</hi> For the two firſt exceptions he agreed with <hi>Barkley,</hi> as to the third, he ſaid, that there can be no action before the breach of the promiſe, or covenant; But the breach here is before the ſix years; for the non performance of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a breach and a breach is a damnificationn. In one <hi>Boughtons</hi> caſe, the non payment is a damnification But all the queſtion here was whether that ought to be pleaded but I conceive that it need not; for by the Statute-law the action is taken away. And it being a general law, the court ought <hi>ex officio</hi> to taken notice of it. For in that after verdict, if it appears that there is no cauſe of action, although the verdict be found for the Plaintiff, he ſhall never have Iudgement. And upon the matter that latches in time amounts to a releaſe in law, &amp; the proviſo cannot ayd you. For every man ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended without thoſe diſabilities: for that, that he would ſhew that he would have advantage of it. And <hi>Crook</hi> of the ſame opinion for the reaſons given before, and ſaid, that although the Statute took away the Common law; yet it is good law, and done for the eaſe of the ſubject, and for that ſhall be favoured, as the Statute of limitations in all caſes. But he ſaid, the non performance was not a damnification before the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought. As if I be bound as for ſurety for <hi>A.</hi> who is bound to ſave me harmleſſe; Although he does not pay it at the day, There is not a breach before the arreſt or Iudgement. For by the Iudgement, the lands and goods are liable; But for the arreſt, his body is troubled, for that now the Scriveners put in ſuch obligations that they ſave harmleſſe the party, and pay the money at the day; But for the other matters, in all he agreed, and cited <hi>Richardſon</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> Caſe. Where a payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day, was adjudged a payment at the day. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> That is not found that there is any ſufficient notice given to the Defendant by the Plaintiff of the agreement made, which he ought to have. And he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed <hi>in omnibus</hi> with <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and ſaid, that Scriveners uſe things, <hi>ex abundanti. Richardſon,</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>habuit notitiam</hi> in the Declaration,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49570:68"/> but does not ſay by whom. Yet after verdict it ſhall be intended a good notice. And although that <hi>Nichols</hi> had given the notice, it is ſufficient. If there be a Leaſe for years upon condition, that he doe not aſsign, the other accepts the rent of the Afsignee before notice, He ſhall not be bound by that acceptance before notice. But if notice may be proved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Plaintiff, or by any, although it be by a meer ſtranger; It is ſufficient. <hi>Yelverton</hi> denied that, for he ſaid; That none but privies can give the notice of it, as the caſe is. <hi>Et adjournatur.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In Manninghams</hi> caſe. The doubt was this, A condition of an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to <hi>Manningham,</hi> was that he ſhould pay after his death to his Executors after his death 10 <hi> l. per annum</hi> to the uſe of the Children of <hi>Manningham.</hi> And <hi>Manningham</hi> dyed, and there was no Executor, whether the payment ſhould be to the Adminiſtrator, and ſo the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forfeited. <hi>Berkly</hi> ſaid, that it ought to be payed to the Adminiſtrator: for an Executor includes an Adminiſtrator; And this money is as aſſets, if not to ſatisfie debts, yet to perform this caſe which is illsgal. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 7. And alſo if a man limit a thing to be done to his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that may be done to his Adminiſtrators. So that the nominating of the Executor, is not but an expreſſe intention to whom the money ſhall be paid (<hi>viz.</hi> to him who preſents his perſon. And he compares that to the caſe of 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18. A rent upon a condition reſerved to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, goes to the Adminiſtrators. 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Dy.</hi> 309. <hi>Cranmers</hi> caſe. Where it ſeemed that if a leaſe be made to one for life, and after to his Executors for years; that the Executors ſhall not have the term as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, 32. <hi>E.</hi> 3. A <hi>quid juris clamat Fitzharb.</hi> A Leaſe for life, to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors for years in remainder, Leſſee for life atturns ſaving the term; which proves that the Executor had that as privy, not as ſtrangers. And he cited <hi>Chapmans</hi> and <hi>Daltons</hi> caſe, the principall. So that the Infant and the Executors ſhall have the money in right of the teſtator: and therefore it goes to the Adminiſtrator.</p>
                  <p>Secondly The Executor extends to an adminiſtrator. 8. <hi>rep.</hi> 135. there kindes of Executors: and an Adminiſtrator is an Excecutor <hi>datinus.</hi> 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. An action is brought againſt divers executors by the Statute: when ſome appears upon the diſtreſſe, it anſwers, that extends to an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator although the Statute names only Executors.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It does not appear here that <hi>Manningham</hi> made not Executors, for it may be that he made Executors, and that they dyed inteſtate or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probate. And he cited 18. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And <hi>Shelleyes</hi> caſe 1. <hi>rep.</hi> and 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi> If Executors dye before probate. It is in Law a dying inteſtate, <hi>Richardſon.</hi> Here is but meer truſt; and as it hath been ſaid; It doth not appear whether he had made Executors or not. For if he dye, and makes Executors, and they dye before probate, or refuſe, he dyes <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtato,</hi> but not inteſtate; Nor ſhall it be queſtioned, if the obligation had been to pay to <hi>Manningham</hi> only, or to him and his Executors. But it goes to the adminiſtrators. But becauſe that he had ſpecially put his Executor; Whether he ought to have the forfeiture of the obligation, or whether he ought to have the ſum to be annually payed to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator. <hi>Berkley,</hi> the letters of adminiſtration make mention, that he dyed <hi>ab inteſtaro. Atthow,</hi> That is matter <hi>de hors,</hi> but by the declaration it is clear that he dyed inteſtate. And the action brought by Adminiſtrator who who had not any cauſe of action. Secondly, admitt that there was an Executor, and the money payed to him; that is not aſſets; For it is not the money of <hi>Manningham,</hi> but taken by him to pay to another. And <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid: If the party had dyed inteſtate, by the Common law, the Adminiſtrator is Executor, and all things that were to be performed by the Executor, are to be performed by the Adminiſtrator. There was an obligation to <hi>A.</hi> to pay to the Executors of <hi>B.</hi> It ſhall be more doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there: whether it ſhall be payed to the Adminiſtrator. But the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation here is to <hi>Manningham</hi> himſelf. Now his Executors comprehend Adminiſtrators: And <hi>Needhams</hi> caſe is plain in that. And the mention
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49570:71"/> was that the money ſhall be payed to theſe that ſucceed him in his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtate. Now it was not the intent that it ſhould be loſt if he dyed without Executors. <hi>Crook</hi> an action of debt being brought againſt an Executor upon an obligation; <hi>plene adminiſtravit</hi> is pleaded. Then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator being included in the word Executor, there is a good cauſe of Action. And the Court ſeemed to be of the ſame opinion. <hi>Sed adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur.</hi>

Vpon which it was demurred. <hi>Atthowe</hi> for the Plaintiff, That <hi>Shelton</hi> here is incumbent in poſſeſsion by preſentation or Collation by By the Stat. the preſentation &amp; induction of that is void. In <hi>Coo.</hi> 41, 51. There is in <hi>Hollands</hi> caſe, a difference between voidance by act of Parliament, and void by Eccleſiaſtical Law. For before the Statute, by the taking of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond benefice, the firſt Church was void. But not ſo that the lapps incurred upon it. <hi>Greens</hi> Caſe, If the Biſhop collate before the 6 months incurre, the Collatee is Incumbent, but the Patron may preſent at any time after, for that fills the Church, but not againſt the Patron, and hinders that no laps may incurre to another. In Sir <hi>Henrie Gawdies</hi> caſe for the Church of <hi>Walſocken.</hi> The Church there became void, and within 14 days after, The King preſented one to it <hi>jure prerogativ. ſuae.</hi> The preſentee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues poſſeſsion above 30 years, and then the Mannor and the Advowſon came to Sir <hi>Henry Gawdy,</hi> the Church is void, and the King preſents again, and was diſturbed by Sir <hi>Henry.</hi> For that the King brought a <hi>Quare impedit.</hi> And adjudged that the preſentation of the King within the ſix moneths, was not an uſurpation. But if he had preſented in his own right, there ſhould have been an uſurpation. When a title by laps is in the King, if any preſent, the King may remove him during his life, by <hi>Quare impedit.</hi> All this appears hy <hi>Baskervills</hi> caſe; but if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent die, the term of the King is gone; but if he reſign not, but the King may preſent during the life of the Incumbent, And that was a grand inconveniency, that after ſo long poſſeſsion in that manner the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent may be removed by the King. And for that purpoſe was the Statute in the firſt clauſe of the exception made. That the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pardon, it would be a wrong to him, and an exception ought to be of the ſame nature. The taking of the ſecond benefice, is not a tort, and therefore a title of the <hi>Quare impedit</hi> accrewed to the King. As for the pluralities, the words of the Statute are, that it ſhall be doid, as if he was naturally dead, and therefore it is meerly and actually void. If a man takes a ſecond benefice and dies, iſſue ought to be taken whether the firſt <hi>vacabit per mortem.</hi> And it was found that, not; For it was ſold before the death of the Incumbent. <hi>Yelverton</hi> If he took the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, yet he might have the tithes of the firſt.

But that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49570:77"/> ought to be intended by the cuſtom within every Mannor within the Realm, Whatſoever a Copiholder does is by Cuſtom. The Caſe here is that it ſhall be void by the death of the Leſſor which is an Act of God; That was, that if Copiholder made a Leaſe for years, and afterwards aliens: that to be void againſt the Alienee would be unreaſonable. 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> There was a Caſe referred to the Iudges out of Chancery which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in Sergeants Inne. <hi>Littleton,</hi> 59 <hi>b. Armesſtrong</hi> Lord of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor preſcribes that a Copiholder upon the change of every Lord; ſhould pay a Fine.

That is a good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom For it is the act of God. So in our Caſe, the cuſtom is void a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Heir, which is by the act of God. In ſome Caſes a cuſtom alters the nature of a Free-hold land. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 84. <hi>Perrymans</hi> Caſe. A Feoffment ſhall not be good untill it be preſented in the Court of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, a good cuſtom. If a free-hold eſtate may be controlled by a cuſtom a <hi>multo fortiori</hi> a Copi-hold eſtate. <hi>Barkley</hi> argued on the other ſide. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be found for the Plaintiff. Yet if the cuſtome be void; a void cuſtome is no cuſtome. And for that it is ſaid in the Earl of <hi>Leceſters</hi> caſe. That a void cuſtome cannot be confirmed by Act of Parliament. And that is a void cuſtome. We ought to conſider the nature of a Copyhold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; By the Common law it is but an Eſtate at will: But the Common law ſo takes notice to eſtabliſh it by a cuſtome. That there may be <hi>poſſeſſio Fratris</hi> of it, and he may have Treſpaſs againſt his Lord. If Tenant at will be out-lawed, his Eſtate is determined. But Copyhold is not determined or forfeited by Out-lawry. As it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi> So that the Law takes notice of it as of an other Eſtate of Inheritance. Where an Heir after his death may enter as Heir at Common law, and have Treſpaſs; becauſe that it deſcends. At Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law he had power to make a Leaſe for a year. For it is not the cuſtome of the Mannor that he may make ſuch a Leaſe; For then it is pleaded, If a Copiholder makes a Leaſe for divers years without alleging a cuſtome or Licence of the Lord, he cannot maintain an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione firm.</hi> againſt his Lord, but perhaps againſt a Stranger. It may be, then if it be the very Law, if he may make a Leaſe for one year, if this cuſtome be good; It will be contrary to the very liberty of the Eſtate, 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer Solomons</hi> Caſe. Cuſtom, that Tenant in Fee-ſimple ſhall not make a Leaſe for more than 5 years is void. So <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſays, That a Condition that the Feoffee ſhould not alien, was void. And a Condition that Tenant in tayl ſhould not ſuffer a Common reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is void. Becauſe that it reſtrains that Liberty which is annexed to the Eſtate. And for the difference between the Father and the Heir in our Caſe there is not any difference; For the Heir is all one with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>in loco patris.</hi> For he might have Treſpaſs by diſcent of a Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Sir <hi>William Herberts</hi> Caſe. And then if the Father ſhall be bound by the Leaſe, ſo ſhall the Heir. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, That Iudgement ought to be given for the Plaintiff. Copihold as it is created by Cuſtome, ſo in all it is guided by Cuſtome; For at the Common law a Copiholder could not make a Leaſe for a year, But becauſe that it is a general cuſtome of all Mannors in <hi>England:</hi> For it is not but a meer Eſtate at will by the Common law. Then this cuſtome is not againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Eſtate. For a Cuſtome inables that the Leaſe, and a Cuſtome ought to deſtroy it upon a Contingency as here by the death of the Father; For that the Lord may know his Tenant. And therefore the Caſe is reaſonable, and not to be compared to the caſe of a Freehold in <hi>Dyer.</hi>

Copyholder makes a Leaſe for a year. But if he dye within the year, his Heir within age, it ſhall be void againſt the Lord. So that the Lord during the nonage ſhall have the Copihold to hold for his Services is a good Cuſtome. And ſo in our Caſe. <hi>Hutton</hi> agreed, That at the Common law it might be reſtrained by cuſtome. And a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that a Leaſe for 3 years ſhall be void, if the Leſſor dye during the term, is a good Condition. Without doubt the cuſtome is as old as the Eſtate, then it is as good to abridge the Eſtate, as to the other to create it is: It is reaſonable too. For the Lord ſhould have his Tenant in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, by which he may the better pay his Fine. But if the Leaſe be made by Licence of the Lord, It is a Confirmation. For that, if the Copiholder makes a Leaſe for years with Licence, and dies without Heir, The Lord ſhall not avoid the Leaſe. In ſome place the cuſtome is, If a Copiholder dies before <hi>Candlemas,</hi> the Executor ſhall have it for that year, to remove and diſpoſe the Copiholders Eſtate; Cuſtome in this Caſe you ſee <hi>tolls</hi> the Heir. And he agreed the Caſe and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence cited by <hi>Atthowe</hi> out of <hi>Cook, Littleton. Harvey</hi> agreed, That it is a good cuſtome for the Lord, and for the Tenant; For the Lord to know his Tenant, and for the Tenant to have the Eſtate, and pay the Fine. <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> agreed alſo, the Leaſe for a year is in it ſelf made by cuſtom, And the ſame cuſtome may confound it; For there is a concurrence of others, or one may controll another. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A Leaſe for years, provided the Leſſor may enter at his will that is a good leaſe, determinable at will, being <hi>uno flatu</hi> ſo. So in our Caſe; But it is done, that a Copiholder within the year ſurrenders his Copihold, that the Leaſe ſhall be void. That is an unreaſonable cuſtome. In the Kings Bench, It was adjudged, A Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder makes a Leaſe for years by Licence, and the cuſtome, if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee was not in poſſeſsion at the time of the death of the Leſſor, that it ſhall be void. Leſſee aſsigns that over, and the Aſsignee holds it; For cuſtome ought to be taken ſtrictly. And he agreed the Caſe put by <hi>Hutton,</hi> of an Executor; And the difference that againſt the Leſſor it ſhould not determine; And the reaſon put before. And ſo judgement was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

The difference here is, That the King preſented, If the preſentee of one without title is admitted and inſtituted, the Patron may bring a <hi>quare impedit</hi> with preſentation, for it is in vain for him to preſent when the Church is full. But if a common perſon recover, and had a writ to the Biſhop, if the Ordinary return that it is full before of his own preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is good; As if one recover, he may enter if he will, without a writ of execution to the Sheriff. And in this caſe the ſecond preſentation does not make mention of the other preſentation, or revoke it. But if the Ordinary had returned an other preſented by Symony, under the great Seal; And that the other in that was revoked, that is good. For it is an execution of the Iudgement, &amp; may be pleaded in abate of the Writ. But if this return ſhould be allowed by this trick, all the recoveries in a <hi>quare impedit</hi> ſhould be to no purpoſe. <hi>Harvey</hi> only preſent, agreed that the Iudgement ought to be executed, and that that is a new deviſe.

                  <head>Sir Richard Dorrel againſt Blagrave.</head>
                  <p>SIr <hi>Richard Dorrell</hi> was Plaintiff in action of debt upon an Obligation of 400 <hi>l.</hi> againſt <hi>Blagrave,</hi> who demanded oyer of the condition, which was, that if <hi>Blagrave</hi> fulfilled and kept all Covenants and agreements in an Indenture, &amp;c. between him and the Plaintiff, which on his part is to be performed and kept; Then the Defendant pleads that he had performed all the Covenants on his part to be performed, &amp;c. And the Plaintiff ſhews that <hi>Blagrave</hi> the elder, by his Indenture granted a rent of 20 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> to one that he intended to marry, for her joynture, which was to commence after his death; And that it was out of all his lands in <hi>Watchfield.</hi> And afterwards by the ſame Indenture, he Covenants that he was ſeiſed of a good and perfect eſtate in Fee ſimple of lands and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Watchfield</hi> to the value of 40 <hi> l. per annum.</hi> And he aſsigns for breach that <hi>Blagrave</hi> was not ſeiſed of an Eſtate in Fée of the lands and tenements aforeſaid in <hi>Watchfield.</hi> Whereupon the Defendant demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And <hi>Heidley</hi> moved two queſtions; Firſt, that admitting the breach here well aſsigned, yet the obligation is not forfeited. And then when the Defendant is bound, that he perform all Covenants on his part to be performed, and not to the Covenants broken. As if Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee for years (rendring a rent at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and the Annunciation) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to pay the rent at a day, and afterwards he fail; and then a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is bound that he perform all Covenants, &amp;c. That extends to the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of payment, which is paſt here in our caſe. And by the whole Court not allowed: For by ſuch means all aſſurances of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded. And now in this caſe the Indenture and the Obligation ſhall be ſealed and delivered at the ſame time. But if the Obligation had been
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49570:83"/> ſealed afterwards at another day, yet it was allowed. For by <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Suppoſe that the Condition of the Obligation recites the grant, &amp;c. And the condition is, that if the land charged be to the value of 40 <hi> l. per an.</hi> that will be a good condition, and the Obligation ſhall be forfeit. If the condition was that the Land was then of ſuch a value, it was preſently a breach of the Condition. The ſecond matter was, whether the breach was well aſsigned or not And <hi>Richardſ.</hi> &amp; <hi>Yelvert.</hi> held that the breach is not well aſsigned. There are two things in the Covenant, one of the Eſtate, another of the value. Here may be a breach to be aſsigned upon the Eſtate, but then it ought to be general: For the grant out of all his lands and tenements in <hi>Watchfield,</hi> is not a concluſion to him who had lands and tenements in <hi>Watchfield,</hi> then the Obligation is forfeited. As if one be obliged to make a Feofment to <hi>I. S.</hi> of all his lands which he had by deſcent in <hi>D.</hi> If he had no lands there, it is not a forfeiture. So here. But if the rent was granted out of particular land, as out of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> There the grantor is included to ſay, but that he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> which was granted. As to this diverſity, the word <hi>praedictis</hi> had relation to lands and tenements in <hi>Watchfield,</hi> for no lands were named. But the material thing is the value, &amp;c. And if <hi>praedict.</hi> goes to all the Lands, then the breach goes to more than the Covenant, and then it is not met with. But admit that it goes to all, yet it is all one: For the intention of the parties was, that the value of 40 <hi>l.</hi> joynture <hi>per annum</hi> ſhall be mentioned. But the Plaintiff does not mention the value. And it is ſure that the word <hi>praedict.</hi> may goe to all the lands in <hi>Watchfield,</hi> or to lands of 40 <hi>l.</hi> And if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had rejoyned, he might have rejoyned generally, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That he was ſeiſed of lands in <hi>Watchfield</hi> in Fee ſimple, and he is not forced to ſhew his particular eſtate in the lands. And admitting they had gone to tryal upon that iſſue, what might the Iurors find. And if they had found the value, it is nothing to the breach; That is more than was in their charge, and ſo void. But <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> on the contrary, and ſaid, that the breach is well aſsigned. And <hi>Hutton</hi> took this difference, That if the Covenant was that he was ſeiſed of ſuch particular lands of ſuch value; The breach ought to be aſsigned in particular alſo; but where it is, that he was ſeiſed of lands of ſuch a value, the breach is now well aſsign'd, &amp; here it is a recital of lands, of the value of 40 <hi> l. per an.</hi> &amp; to that <hi>predict</hi> has relation. And it does not appear to us if he had more lands in <hi>Watchfield,</hi> than of 40 <hi> l. per an.</hi> But theſe things were agreed by all. Firſt that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient pleading in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 6. is now changed, and the general plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Covenants in the Indenture in form, although that the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is good: And the Plaintiff ought to ſhew the particular Covenant broken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, in the principal Caſe, if the Plaintiff had replyed, that he was not ſeiſed of lands and tenements in <hi>Watchfield</hi> in Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without <hi>praedict.</hi> or <hi>deque fuit ſeiſe de nullis terris vel tenementis praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis</hi> in <hi>Watchfield</hi> of the value of 40 <hi> l. in modo &amp; forma, &amp; ſecundum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam conventionis,</hi> is a good aſsignment of the breach; And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant forced to ſhew the particulars. The Plaintiff diſcontinued the principal ſute, and begins again; but that he might not doe without the licenſe of the Court, as they ſaid, Becauſe that they might agree afterwards to give Iudgement.</p>

And he ſhews that he provided Sattin and Gold-lace, and made the Apparel, and ſhews of what value the Stuff was, and what he deſerved for his labour, which amounted to the value of 39 l. and that he required the Defendant ſuch a day to pay him, which was within ſix years before the action brought, but the promiſe was laid to be 7 years before. The Defendant pleads the Statute of Limitations, and that the Plaintiff did not bring his Action within the ſix years after the promiſe made, nor within the 3 years after the Parliament ended. But he does not ſhew when it ended. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which there was a Demurrer. And by the Court the ending of the Parliament néeds not to be ſhewn here; For the Queſtion is not upon the 3 years after the ending of the Parliament, but upon the matter in Law, whether an Action ought to be brought within ſix years after the promiſe, or after the requeſt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, That it ought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix years after the promiſe. Here are two cauſes of Action (for the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49570:84"/> words of the Statute are within ſix yenrs afcer the cauſe of Action) the promiſe, and the requeſt, and the promiſe is the principal,<note place="margin">Trin. <hi>5</hi> Car. Com.

And the miſchief that the Statute intended to remedy was, that a man was ſhould not be put to the proof of the matter <hi>de facto</hi> ſo long time after. And if the requeſt is ſaid to be the cauſe of Action, the promiſe may be laid 20 years before, and although that may be proved. But the other 3 Iuſtices were againſt him, and ſaid, That the intention of the Statute is, within 6 years after the cauſe of the Sute given, which is not untill after requeſt. As if one promiſed to another ſo much when he ſhould mary his Daughter. The 6 years there ſhall be after the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; Or if one promiſe ſuch a ſum to one at his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſuch a place, from whence it is not impoſsible to return within ſix years; The payment ſhall be after the return, and there is not a cauſe of Action before: and alſo the promiſe and the Requeſt are intire; For the requeſt is part of the promiſe, and the promiſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire untill the requeſt. They agréed, if a man makes a requeſt, and ſuffer the 6th year to paſs before an action brought, and then makes a new requeſt. And this Caſe was more ſtrong, becauſe the conſideration was future. <hi>Heidley</hi> ſaid, there was a difference where the requeſt is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and where it is alleged but for form. As if I ſell a Horſe for 10 l. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and after the 6 years brought an Action upon the Caſe upon an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> againſt the Vendee, and ſhews in his Declaration, that he was to be paid when he would require it, <hi>&amp; licet ſaepius requiſit. &amp;c.</hi> within the ſix years; Here the Plaintiff is barred; For it was due by the contract, and the requeſt is but formal. If a man brings an Action within the 6 years, and afterwards is non-ſuted for want of requeſt ſhewen where it was neceſsary, and makes a new requeſt after the 6 years, and brings his Action; It is good; Which was granted by the Court. And in this Caſe, the Court taxed <hi>Henden,</hi> for adviſing the Defendant to plead the Statute, and hazard it upon Demurrer. When he might have tryed firſt the matter in fact. But <hi>Henden</hi> ſaid, it was dangerous not to plead the Statute. For the opinion of the Kings Bench and Exchequer ſeemed to be, that it ought to be pleaded. By the Court, when it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent within the Record, that the Action is brought after the 6 years cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they doubted not but the Statute ought to be ſhewn in arreſt of Iudgement. But the doubt is when a general iſſue is pleaded in an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> or Treſpaſs, and it does not appear in the Treſpaſs or <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit,</hi> that it was above the ſix years, the Statute now may be given evidence.</p>

For which he prayed Iudgement for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, It is doubtfull, whether the words will bear an action; Barrettor is a notorious offender, and if he be to be convicted he is to be fined and bound to his good behaviour. And it is hard to make a definition of a Common Barrettor, but a deſcription may be made, that he is a mover of Sutes and contentious in diſpoſitions and practice. But whether the words ſhall have relation to him as Attorney is the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Birchleys</hi> Caſe, <hi>A corrupt man.</hi> This directly relates to his practice, ſo
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49570:85"/> of Couſener. But ſuch a thing which ought not to be applyed to him as Attorney is not actionable. <hi>Common Brabler, Swaggerer, Breaker of the Peace,</hi> which Barrettor comprehends, being ſpoken of an <hi>Attorney,</hi> are not actionable. For they do not refer to him as Attorney. And the Statute cited before of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. It is to be intended, if he be found to be a Barrettor. And then he ſhould be put out of the Court. And here if there had been a communciation of him as an Attorney, then it would be actionable. But it ought to be laid <hi>habens Collequium</hi> of him as At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney; For then of neceſsity it ought to be underſtood of his Office. And ſo alſo the words, <hi>Truſt him not, he will cut your Throat,</hi> ought to be underſtood of him as Attorney, he will cut the throat of your Cauſe. <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> on the contrary. And ſaid the words here are as well applicable to his profeſsion, as if it had béen found, that there was a <hi>Colloquium</hi> of him as Attorney. For it is laid that he was an Attorney, and that he lived by that profeſsion: and that the Defendant maliciouſly to hinder him in this profeſsion ſpoke theſe words. It hath been ſaid what a Common Barrettor is, and his puniſhment is appointed by 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Littleton</hi> alſo mentions, ſpeaking of Feoffments made to Barrettors, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Quarrellors, then being ſpoken of an Attorney: none but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome men will go to quarrelſome Attorneys. For although he deals in Sutes, yet his carriage and practice ought to be fair and peaceable. And without Queſtion if it be ſaid, <hi>Thou art a couſening Attorney,</hi> an Action lies; But by <hi>Harvey,</hi> perhaps <hi>Couſening</hi> generally will not. And if of a common perſon it be ſaid, He is convicted of common barretry, It will bear an Action. And by <hi>Hutton,</hi> to ſay of an Attorney he is a Recuſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, it will bear an Action. If it be ſaid of a Iudge that he is a Common Barrettor, an action lies. And if it be actionable for ſpeaking ſo of a Iudge, it is ſo of an Attorney; For he is in an inferiour ranck a Miniſter of Iuſtice, and he ought to be choſen of the moſt honeſt, diſcreet and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men: and theſe words if true, make him incapable of being Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney here. As in <hi>Smalls</hi> Caſe before, it was held, To ſay of a Biſhop, he is a Papiſt will bear an Action; For then he cannot hold his Biſhoprick. If one ſaid of a Merchant, he is a poor man, is not actionable. But if he ſaid he is worth nothing, had been queſtionable. Becauſe that it <hi>tantamounts</hi> to a Banckrupt. And by them the word <hi>Iudas</hi> is material here, for <hi>loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ut vulgus.</hi> If he had ſaid you have plaid the <hi>Iudas</hi> with your Clyent, without doubt is actionable. Which <hi>Richardſon</hi> alſo agreed, and ſaid if one ſays of an Attorney, that hes a falſe Attorney, an action lies. <hi>Sed adjournatur.</hi>

                  <p>Points 2. Firſt whether <hi>Francis Bigod</hi> who had Eſtate in ſpecial tayl in poſſeſsion, had alſo any right in the antient entayl left in him at the time of his Attainder, or whether it were not in abeiance in reſpect of the Feoffment made 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and whether that right did accew unto the King by the Attainder of <hi>Francis,</hi> and the general Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. or by the particular act of Attainder of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that there was a right of the old entayl remaining in him, and that the King ought to have it, together with that eſtate in ſpecial entayl in poſſeſsion freed and diſcharged thereof as long as the Eſtate entayl endured.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of this point, I ſhall occaſionally ſpeak of rights of Actions real, given or not given to the King upon Attainder of Treaſon, by force of Statute 26 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. or of the general Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for this Statute is ſo near of kin to that conſervation of antient Rights, that we muſt foreſee that we do not in the Iudgement of this Cauſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Statute <hi>ex aliqua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether there be a Remitter in the Caſe after Attainder of Treaſon, and if there be ſuch a Remitter here, when the Remitter begins and in whom, whereas nothing hath as yet been diſtinctly ſaid. I am of opinion, that there ought to be no remitter in this Caſe to the old Entayl, and thereby I adde more, that if there be a remitter, it is but for a time, By the Office following it is remitted and ended, I muſt profeſs that whatſoever I have thought upon this Caſe, and adviſed upon it with my ſelf, I have met with two ſtrong affections, Zeal and Indignation; Zeal in the behalf of the King to preſerve the antient Rights of the Crown, and againſt the invaſion of Rebells and Traytors. <hi>Bigod</hi> that ſometimes brought a puiſſant Army into the field to depoſe the King, failing in that enterprize, now to riſe in Queſtion againſt him, that what he could not gain by the ſword, he might ſupplant by the Law; for though <hi>Ratcliff</hi> bear the name of this Caſe, yet I ſee nothing but the hand of <hi>Francis Bigod</hi> his Eſtate, his Right, his Title, Land <hi>per</hi> deſcent that maintains it, therefore let it not ſeem ſtrange that I am warm in this Caſe, for Zeal and Indignation are fervent paſsion, and I do profeſs to give Prerogative to the rights of the Crown in my care and vigilancy, and it is <hi>nobile Officium judicis &amp; debitum</hi> due by Oath of Office to watch for him who works for us, <hi>ne quid detrimenti capit reſpublica,</hi> and if Charity begins at it ſelf, ſo ought Iuſtice to do, that the King who grants Iuſtice to all ſhould not be wanting to himſelf. Becauſe I deſire to be plain and clear in my Arguments, I will make the Queſtions as ſingle as is poſsible, for <hi>multiplex judicii nunc parit conſuſionem, et quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiones quo ſinpliciores eo laudiores, ergo</hi> will I make this firſt point a ſingle
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49570:91"/> Queſtion. Tenant in tayl of Land in poſſeſsion makes a Feoffment in fée, Queſtion, whether any right of the Entayl remaineth in him ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Feoffment, and to what ends and uſes, and what he may do or ſuffer by force of this right in this Queſtion. I take no exception at the validity of the Feoffment made by <hi>Francis Bigod</hi> at <hi>ceſtui que uſe</hi> in tayl by the Statute of R. 3. and not the then Tenant in tayl in poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet notwithſtanding taking the Caſe at the worſt, I am of opinion, that this Feoffment gives away all the Eſtate of the Tenant in tayl; and as concerning the Iſſue in tayl inheritable to that Entayl, and to him in the reverſion, there remains ſtill in the Iſſue a right to that Entayl by force of the Statute <hi>de bonis condi.</hi> and it is confeſſed on both ſides, that there remains a right of that Entayl by force of the Statute, for their uſe, and good, and whether it be for the Leſſor himſelf ſleeping till there be an Heir to claim it, or in the preſervation of the Law which is termed an abeyance, or <hi>in nubibus</hi> is the Queſtion, by which it appears that the exact enumerations of Rights, as <hi>jus habendi, redimendi, percipiendi, poſſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, recuperandi, &amp; finendi,</hi> inferreth that there was no right, becauſe it was none of theſe rights, makes but a noyſe, for there is <hi>jus recuperandi</hi> when the time commeth, but it is in the mean time till the perſon inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table appear, which may put this right in execution, which the Leſſor cannot do againſt his own Feoffment, it is the only Queſtion, and upon this exact diviſion of Rights, they have left out one whole member of Rights, ſuch are the Rights to depart with an Eſtate, and not to get or keep are omitted; ſuch are the Rights to give or releaſe or <hi>jus extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendi,</hi> or <hi>jus renunciandi,</hi> to renounce or diſclaim, of which kind this very right is, That Tenant in tayl hath after the Feoffment, which had not diſcontinued finally to Bar the whole Entayl; for by that Right which is left after the Feoffment, the Eſtate tayl may be recontinued again, for the root of the Entayl is left alive ſtill. Now ſee the reaſon of this, and let the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> of Eſtates tayl, and the pleading and practice upon that Statutes, which are the expoſitions of Law judge, the Statute recites the form of Fee-ſimple conditional which now are intayls, and then ſheweth 2 miſchiefs, that the Donces after iſſue had power to alien and diſinherit their Iſſues, and that the Donors were defeated of their reverſions, both being againſt the minds of the Givers, and the remedy provided in theſe words, It is ordained that the Will of the Giver according to the force of his Gift expreſſed in his Deed, ſhall be from henceforth obſerved, ſo that they to whom the Land was given under ſuch Conditions, ſhall have no power to alien, but that it ſhall remain to their Iſſue after death, and ſhall revert to the Donor after death, and if a Fine be levyed of ſuch Lands <hi>finis ipſi jure ſit nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> but if neither Fine or Feoffment be void, for they are but voidable, not as before when they bound both Heirs and Donors abſolutely, ſo that it appears, whereas before the Statute the Donee had power abſolute <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam;</hi> and ſo totally and in a ſort rightfully to diſinherite their Heirs, the Act being not againſt the rules of poſitive Law, to bar to all purpoſes aſwell his Iſſue as the Giver, as alſo himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince the Statute that very power of Alienation remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, not reſtrained by the Statute, though he may ſtill diſturb and diſcontinue it againſt them by expoſition, which the Statute hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived which as <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith Diſcountenance <hi>cap.</hi> 171. is a wrong to the Iſſue and the Giver, So that upon this Statute I reaſon thus, that the Tenant in tayl hath the whole Eſtate in tayl, and all the right of it in himſelf, and may finally and totally bar it as well againſt his Iſſue, as againſt himſelf by Common recovery, but by Feoffment or Fine he could not, by reaſon of this Statute. And that <hi>ergo ſummum jus,</hi> or <hi>verum jus</hi> intayl, though it be diſcountenanced, is not barred by the Feoffment,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49570:91"/> for it is not in his power by that kind of conveiance, and a <hi>non poſſe ad non eſſe valet argumentum neceſſario negative,</hi> ſo that the Argument ſtands thus, What the Tenant in tayl had and hath not parted withall remaineth in him ſtill; but the main right in tayl he had, and hath not parted, <hi>ergo</hi> it remaineth in him ſtill; for <hi>qui non habet poteſtatem alienandi, habet neceſſitatem retinendi.</hi> If you ſay that he hath parted with it, I deny it, for the Statute hath taken from him that power by Fine or Feoffment only, <hi>finis ipſe jure ſit nullus,</hi> which before he could have done; and the practice of the Law is anſwerable to this, both towards the Donor and towards the Iſſue; The Donor hath two things whereby he may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitted and prejudiced, the one in his Rent reſerved, the other in his reverter, but the Iſſue prejudiced only in his Deſcender. Now for the Donor, when the Donee hath made a Feoffment and hath excluded himſelf from all rights as concerning himſelf, yet the Donor ſhall by force of this Statute, which at the Common law he could not. And if the Donor will releaſe all his right in the Land to the Donee after a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance by Feoffment, his releaſe though it will extinguiſh no right to the very Land, yet it will extinguiſh Rents, which proves that the Donee by his Feoffment cannot diſmiſs himſelf of all his right, but that by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> his alienation is diſabled as to that, but that the Donor may avow for the Rent. But whereſoever Tenant in tayl ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a Recovery, or levies a Fine, the Rents together with the entayl cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And the anſwer as to that is imperfect to reſemble it to the Caſe of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in ſee ſimple doth alien, and yet the Lord may avow upon him, for the Caſes have no reſemblance, for as <hi>Littleton</hi> well diſtinguiſheth, when Tenant in fee hath departed with his whole Eſtate, he is no more Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Lord to avow upon; though the Lord if he Will may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow upon him for the arrerages, and if the Lord after future alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on releaſe to him all his rights in the Land, the Releaſe is void to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the Rents and Services, in all which it differs materially from the other Caſe, and it is an equall proportion of the Law, That when the Lord aliens his ſignory, the Tenant is to he acquainted, that all Arrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages may be paid, that he may have no after-reckonings, for after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and the Arrerages paid, the avowrie vaniſheth. Now for the Heir in tayl claiming from his Anceſtor after his Feoffment by deſcent from him, thereby allowing a right to remain in him againſt his Feoffment; The Caſe is more difficult, becauſe during the Feoffor there can be no motion of that right, neither by the Feoffor who hath hard himſelf, nor his Iſſue, becauſe his Right is not yet come; yet let me put this Caſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. upon the opinion of <hi>Mountague</hi> Chief Iuſtice. If Tenant in tayl Iointreſs make a Feoffment, the perſon to whom the land doth belong after her death may enter and hold it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his right. Now till ſuch Entry there is a diſcontinuance, but when the Iſſue enters he is an Heir intayl, <hi>et quaſi eins per diſcent.</hi> But now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally when Tenant in tayl hath made a Feoffment and dies, the Heir ſhall bring a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Diſcender, and ſhall count that <hi>deſcendere debet</hi> from that Anceſtor that made the diſcontinuance <hi>performam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> and therefore the Writ ſaith <hi>diſcendit jus,</hi> it is as much <hi>devenit jus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that regularly a Feoffment bars all former rights and future rights; yet reſpect to be had to Eſtrangers.<note place="margin">Albanies Caſe, 2 Rep. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Caſe, 1 Rep. 66. 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> And therefore in <hi>Archers</hi> Caſe, Lands were demiſed to one fore life, remainder to his firſt Heir male; Tenant for life made a Feoffment in fee and died, his next Heir was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his right for ever by the Feoffment.</p>
                  <p>A man ſeiſed of Land by right of his Wife, makes a feoffment in fee, and then the Eſtate is made back to the Wife, ſhe is thereby remitted, and her Husband ſhall never be Tenant by the Courteſie, and therefore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49570:92"/> well reſolved, if Tenant in tayl diſcontinue, and levy fine with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, is no bar to the Eſtate tayl.</p>
                  <p>Now this Caſe is irregular, becauſe it ſtandeth by Act of Parliament, which is able to make the ſame Act good to one purpoſe or perſon, and void or voidable to another, as the Statute of Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and binds the party, but is void or voidable againſt the Succeſſors, and ſhall nevertheleſs when they enter, be in by ſucceſsion.</p>
                  <p>And that there is ſtill a right remaining in the Tenant in tayl, appears in that he hath ſtill in him a power to bind it more finally and totally by fine and recovery if he purſue them rightly, and therefore note <hi>Cupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikes</hi> Caſe. If Tenant in tayl with divers remainders over make a Feoffment, and Feoffee vouch not the Feoffee Tenant in tayl in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion but the firſt in Remainder, by the Statute the Feoffees are not bound, but are remitted; and <hi>Maunſells</hi> Caſe there is cited, where one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is a bar to 3 ſeveral Intayls with double voucher.</p>
                  <p>And this is called <hi>jus extinguendi;</hi> which he could not extinguiſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, if not in him and in his power; and therefore there is no cauſe to frame Abeyances needleſs and in vain, but the Law allows not nor admits not but in Caſes of neceſsity, as in the vacancy of Biſhops, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and other Eccleſiaſtical perſons, or the like Remainders to right Heirs upon Freehold, abeyances are not allowed, but where the original Eſtate required them, or where the conſequences of Eſtates and Caſes do require them. As for the firſt in Caſe of ſingle Corporations, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deans, and Parſons which muſt dye, and a vacancy of freehold or a Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> yet living. Or Secondly in Caſe of congruity, as if a man gives a Warranty and die, his Heir in <hi>ventre ſa mere</hi> may not be vouched, but if there be Heir he may be vouched, and a Vouchee may take and plead a Releaſe <hi>quaſi tenens,</hi> or may leaſe a Fine to the Defendant of the Land in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But for Eſtates that of their own nature and origination, creation, are perfect and intire as this Eſtate entayl is, the Law permits not vain affected abeyance or fictions by the voluntary Act of the party, as this, to no good, which ſhould preſerve a right to ſerve the Heir, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the King, which was one of the principal reaſons for the making the Statute 27 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the transferring of uſes into poſſeſsion; Vſes being but a kind of abeyance and ſhift to kéep the profits to the uſe, and defraud the King and Lords of their Eſcheats, and them that had a right to know againſt whom to bring their Actions. <hi>Littleton</hi> was confounded in himſelf when he made an abeyance of <hi>totum ſtatum ſuum,</hi> and yet made an Eſtate for life, which is condemned in <hi>Walſinghams</hi> Caſe by the Iudges. Again, though fictions take place amongſt common perſon, the King is not bound by fictions, and therefore the King is not bound by his remainders by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence feigned upon a common recovery, warrant collateral binds not the King, but warranty with real and actual Aſſets, nor the King is not bound by Eſtoppels of his own recitall <hi>certa ſcientia,</hi> as it is in <hi>Altenwoods</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>And I hold plainly, that as the Land in poſſeſsion is diſtinctly and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given to the King, ſo the right is as literally directly and plainly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King by diſcharge of that ancient right whereof formerly it was bound; for when the Statute ſaith, that the King ſhould have the Lands, ſaving the right of all perſons, other than the Offenders and their Heirs, and ſuch as claim to their uſe, it is plain, that the eye of the Statute was not only upon the Land in poſſeſsion but alſo the rights to the ſame, the one in point of Giving, The other in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing.</p>
                  <p>The Land in poſſeſsion could be but in one, that is in the Offenders, and ſo it was given, but the rights to the ſame Lands might be in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49570:92"/> perſons in the Offendor, or in his Heirs, or in Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Statute ſaith the King ſhall have the Land without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Rights of the Offendors or his Heirs, or any claiming to their uſe, Tenant in tayl diſcontinues, and after diſſeiſeth his Diſcontinuee, and is attainted of Treaſon, he forfeits his Eſtate gained by the Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and alſo his right of Entayl, for he cannot take benefit of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Right againſt the King, by force of the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 32 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and this agrees with the reaſon, and the rule in the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Caſe; for if the Traytor have right to a Strangers land, that ſhall not be given to the King for the quiet of the Stranger being Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor for the quiet of his poſſeſion, but ſuch right ſhall be given to the King being Poſſeſſor for the quiet of his poſſeſsion, and the word Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Statute 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are both ſufficient and fit to carry ſuch right in ſuch Caſes, and no man will diſpute but they are ſufficient to ſave naked rights to the Lands of ſtrangers, &amp; therfore it is not for the count of words, but becauſe it is alleged it was not meant, &amp; ſo it was ſaid in <hi>Digbies</hi> Caſe, and ſo hath Antiquity expounded it for the good of the Subject againſt the King, and againſt the letter of the Law. But can any man imagine that the Parliament that gave the Land to the King ſhould leave a right in the Traytor, in the ſame Land, to defeaf him again of it, ſince the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute gives the right and the Land, and this gives a forfeiture of all rights belonging to the Perſon attainted of Treaſon and their Heirs, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Kings forfeiture is of ſo great importance, that if it be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as large as I take it, it is an avoiding of all the Statute, even that 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. for though they have the word Rights in both Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, even that of 33. doth not include the right of Action to the Lands of Eſtrangers by an Equity againſt the Letter. So for this time the Caſe was abruptly broken off, by reaſon the King had ſent for all the Iudges of every Bench.</p>

                  <p>IN a <hi>quare impedit,</hi> the Plaintiff declares that Iuſtice <hi>Beamont</hi> was ſeiſed in Fée of the Advowſon, of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Derby,</hi> and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Clerk to it, who was inſtituted and inducted, &amp;c. and dies, and that the Advowſon deſcended to <hi>H.

And <hi>Barbara</hi> the Daughter took the Plaintiff to <hi>Husband,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of full age, and then the Church became void. And becauſe the Bayliffs and Burgeſſes preſented, and the Church ſo full within the ſix
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49570:94"/> months, the husband alone brought that action, upon which there was a demurrer. <hi>Davenport</hi> ſaid the action did not lie for the husband alone, but the wife ought to joyn with him. For that uſurpation upon the Infant which he had by deſcent, by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> the 2d. does not turn the Infant to his writ of right. Yet the Vſurper gets the inheritance, and turns his eſtate to a right. And for that he cited <hi>Cook,</hi> 6. 50. <hi>Boſwells</hi> caſe, and 16. <hi>E.</hi> 3. there cited. Where one ſeiſed of a Mannor with an advowſon appendant dies, his heir within age, who ſuffers an uſurpation, and then grants the Mannor, Reſolved that the advowſon does not paſſe, becauſe that the heir had but a right in the advowſon after the uſurpation. So in our caſe, the wife had but a title of action: and than the wife ought to join. As where an obligation is made to a woman who takes a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; the wife ought to joyn with the husband in the action upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. But <hi>Henden</hi> ſaid, that the Husband only might have an action. If a feme covert be ſeiſed of an advowſon in fee, and the Church void, the Husband only may have an action without queſtion. Which was granted by the Court. Then here, the wife being of full age before the avoidance, now the feme being in poſſeſsion of the Advowſon again to all intents and purpoſes. And for that by the expoſition of the Statute of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the force of the uſurpation being upon the Infant, who had it by deſcent, continued but during the incumbency and non-age of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. And it was ſaid by <hi>Richardſon,</hi> That the Infant at full age might preſent, and ſo regain the poſſeſsion without action, at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, by uſurpation ſhe was turned to her writ of Right. And if it was a purchaſe, he was without remedy. Now I demand in this caſe, If there be a death during the avoidance, whether the Executor ſhall have it, or the Husband upon tenant by Courteſie. And he cited the Lord <hi>Stanhops</hi> Caſe; which was, That the Abbot of the Monaſtery of <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was ſeiſed of the advowſon in groſs, and there was an uſurpation in the time of the Abbot; And then came the Statute of diſſolutions, which gave a right, and title to the King; So that that which was in the Abbot was now in the King. Afterwards the King grants that Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by a general grant without recital of the caſe. And adjudged a good grant. But by <hi>Hutton, Warberton,</hi> and <hi>Winch</hi> Iuſtices, were of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion to <hi>Hubbard;</hi> But that was becauſe that there are words in the Statute; that the Subject ſhall have all the King had; which was to induce purchaſers. <hi>Hutton,</hi> If it might appear that the Plaintiff <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the Husband, preſented before the Vſurpation, and was diſturbed; that perhaps would have been a claim, and ſo a remitter. For at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, the remedy for an Infant, was to preſent, and upon admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Inſtitution, &amp;c. of his Clerk he ſhould be remitted, or might have a Writ of right if he pleaſed. But by the Court, the husband on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this caſe might have preſented; And then upon diſturbance, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall have the action. But here the Church was full before the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaid, the intention of the Statute was to give to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant at full age all his Intereſt which he had before uſurpation, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the Incumbent, and non-age of the Infant, the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper had an Eſtate in fee. But after the death of the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, and full age of the Infant, the Eſtate of the Vſurper cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                  </p>
                  <p>By reaſon of which Letter the Lord <hi>Barkley</hi> turned him out of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The Defendant pleads not guilty, which was found for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. And it was moved in arreſt of Iudgement, that the Action here would not lye. <hi>Atthowe</hi> ſaid, that the Action would lye well, by reaſon of the particular loſs the Plaintiff had. And that is proved by <hi>Anne Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> Caſe, <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. Such words that there are ſpoken of a maried woman, are not actionable; But of a Feme ſole who had a Suter, the Action will lye. If one ſaid of a Feme ſole, <hi>That ſhe is a Whore, and ſuch a mans Whore;</hi> It will not bear an Action in our Law: But in the Spiritual Court it will. And perhaps for <hi>Whore</hi> generally there. And in the Caſe of <hi>Anne Mayes</hi> there was a loſs of preferment which ſhe might have. But here the Plaintiff loſt the preferment which he had. If a man ſaid to the Ordinary of a Clark preſented to him, that he is a Baſtard, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or heretique, by reaſon of which words the Ordinary refuſes him; An Action lies for the Clark, for the temporal loſſe; and he cited <hi>Butchers</hi> Caſe and <hi>Stewkleys</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cook</hi> 4. Alſo he cited Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrards</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cook</hi> 4. 18. If one ſaid, <hi>Take not a Leaſe of ſuch an one, I have a Leaſe of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49570:95"/> it,</hi> an Action does not lie. But if the party by reaſon of thoſe words could not demiſe it to one with whom he had Communication for the Leaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then it lies. Or if he ſaid that another had a Leaſe of that, alſo an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lies, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer</hi> 72. One ſaying that a Merchant would be a Banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt is Actionable; Becauſe that no man will truſt him, 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 24. One threatens another if he will come abroad he will beat him; For the threatning an Action does not lie; But if for that Cauſe he could not go abroad about his Buſineſs, an Action will lye.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It hath been objected, that the Action does not lie, Becauſe that it appears that the Letter was written out of the time of Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> which is for Slander. That the Action ought to be brought within two years after the Slander. I agree, if it be brought for ſlanderous words. But this is an Action upon the Caſe only. An Action upon the Caſe for ſlandering of a Title is not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> for the two years, but for the ſix years. So here the Action is not for ſlanderous words; For the Letter does not bear an Action. But for the temporal loſs. But it was reſolved by the Court, That the Action did not lie. For by <hi>Richardſon</hi> Chief Iuſtice, In all Caſes where you will maintain an Action, for words, there ought to be ſome particular words of Slander ſpoken or written, by which the particular loſs came. Here is a Letter it had not any Slander in it; And it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Lord turned him away out of his Service or Office by that Letter, which does not touch him in his Office of Stewardſhip nor his Receivorſhip. If he had written that the Plaintiff was a contentious and troubleſome man, that had been more queſtionable than this is; Yet it would not bear an Action. And <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſaid, that they alwaies conceived Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrards</hi> Caſe not to be Law. For if a man ſaid that he himſelf had a Title to the Land of an other, it is not actionable, although he loſt by that. But if he had ſaid, that another man had Title to the Land of another, that is actionable. And no Caſe can be ſhewen, where an Action upon the Caſe lies upon a particular loſſe, unleſs the words carry ſome ſlander with them. <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, the words of the Letter are not actionable. But if being ſaid to be done maliciouſly and falſeſly, and to the intent the Lord <hi>Barkley</hi> ſhould put him out of his place, and upon that the Lord diſplaced him, then there would be more doubt of it. But here the Iury had found the Defendant guilty, and that ſeemed only to the writing of the Letter, and it might be falſe notwithſtanding. But if the Iury had found that all was falſe, and written of ſet purpoſe, and that for that the Lord diſplaced him, it would be more difficult. But for any thing as appears to us, there is not any thing for which he might be juſtly diſplaced. And alſo it was not ſaid in the Declaration that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had any fee for his Office. And <hi>Richardſon</hi> alſo ſaid, That if it had been found as my Brother <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, Yet it is known that it ſhould be more ſtrong. But then I conceive that the Action does not lye. For it is apparent that nothing in the Letter may be applyed to a particular misbehaviour in his Office. And by the Court, Although the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be laid falſely and maliciouſly; Yet if the words be n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t ſcandalous, yet it ought to be laid falſely and maliciouſly. And he ſaid that it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Court, Where an Action upon the Caſe was brought for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to indict a man, and upon the Indictment the Iury found <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> There the Indictee was clear; And yet for the conſpiracy the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid, which was <hi>Blakes</hi> Caſe.

And upon the laſt words <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant</hi> Hitcham <hi>bound my Son over to, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaid that his Son was bound to appear at the Quarter Seſsions; And cauſed an Indictment to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt him, Becauſe he being elected Conſtable refuſed to take his oath, or to execute his office; And upon that Indictment the Sergeant gave evidence to the grand Iury, and they found the Indictment; And upon that Iudgement was given, that he ſhould be amerced, that eſtreated. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this bar the Plaintiff dumurred. <hi>Finch</hi> for the Plaintiff. And firſt he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Exceptions which were taken before to the Declaration &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt that it did not appear by the Declaration that the Plaintiff was Iuſtice of Peace at the time of the ſpeaking of the words. To that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, That is ſufficient in the Declaration to ſhew that he was a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace at the time. For it is, <hi>per multos annos jam ultime elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos et adhinc eſt,</hi> and that the Declaration coming in <hi>M.</hi> 5 <hi>Car.</hi> If it was <hi>per multos annos ulterius, &amp;c.</hi> It was at the time of the ſpeaking: For it was <hi>Paululum</hi> before the Action commenced. And alſo the Defendant ſays in his Bar, that the King made him a Iuſtice of Peace, and that he was not a Iuſtice of Peace at the Seſsions; And although that he was not a Iuſtice of Peace at the <hi>Parlance,</hi> Yet the words are actionable, which charge him with Injuſtice, when he was, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was objected, that part of the words were not alleged to be ſpoken of the Plaintiff: But the Declaration is, <hi>That in a matter, &amp;c. Mr. Sergeant did, &amp;c.</hi> which is directed to the firſt words. But the ſubſequent words are induced ſuch like afterwards. <hi>Ad tunc &amp; ibidem,</hi> the Defendant ſaid, <hi>And he did me injuſtice, &amp;c.</hi> And although the firſt words were laid to be ſpoken of the Plaintiff, yet the laſt words not. But <hi>and he did me, &amp;c.</hi> which ought to be taken, That they were ſpoken of the Plaintiff. For it is <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem,</hi> upon the ſame Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And alſo the Defendant cleared that. For he juſtifies thoſe words as ſpoken of the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It was objected, that the words themſelves are not actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. In Actions for words, it is as in Wills; The beſt argument will be from the words themſelves, yet we can borrow light from other words in the ſame Will. Which I will recite The proverbial Verſe. <hi>Quid de quoque viro &amp; cui dicas ſaepe caveto. Quid, &amp;c.</hi> Some words declare all malice, which are not actionable of ſome perſons they may be ſpoken of, <hi>(quo)</hi> ſome only actionable being ſpoken of ſuch a man 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>The Duke of Buckingham hath no more conſcience than a Dog.</hi> Thoſe words upon the Statute of <hi>Scandala magnatum</hi> are actionable. 10 <hi>Iac.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northamptons</hi> Caſe. It was reſolved in the Starchamber, that to publiſh falſe rumors of any of the Peers of the Realm was puniſhable at the Common law. And if one heard ſuch words, and reported them again, it is puniſhable, But not in a Common perſons caſe. But this difference there was reſolved; That to ſay of Commons perſon generally that he heard ſo, is not actionable, if he name the perſon. If one ſays of a Merchant he is a Banckrupt, it is actionable; not of the Defendant. If one ſaid of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant he is an Ambidexter, it is actionable; not, if of a Merchant. It is a general rule, that ſlander of every man in his profeſsion is actionable; Much more of the Plaintiff in his profeſsion being a Iuſtice of peace. For the words themſelves, if they be taken together or aſunder are action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49570:99"/> The ground of the ſpeaking was, that there was a communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Injuries done to him by the Plaintiff, but take them aſunder,<note place="margin">Trin. <hi>7.</hi> Car. Com. Banc.</note> and none of them but with the circumſtances here will bear an action. Firſt, that he was a Iudge, Witneſs, and party; That is againſt the Law to be Iudge and party. They who are Duelliſts are Iudges and parties and Executioners. Iudge and party is as much as to ſay he is partial, and he did oppreſſe me. That ſhews that he was not Iudge and party fairly. But they have objected that this word oppreſſe is incertain; for he may be oppreſſed with overwait, or hunger and cold. But this caſe cannot have any ſuch ſuch ſence. But here it is intended the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Iuſtice. But this caſe was put off till the next day by nine in the morning.</p>

                  <p>As to the Bar. That is naught. it appears by the Bar, that the Defendant was not called to anſwer the Articles aforeſaid. For he ſaid the Plaintiff would not proceed upon them; Then the Plaintiff might be Iudge, witneſs and party, and not oppreſs me, &amp;c. And it is not Iuſtice for one Iuſtice of Peace to refuſe to proceed. As here, If Articles be given to him, the Witneſſes perhaps are not ready, and although he requeſt the Plaintiff to proceed, it is not the Office of a Iuſtice of peace to promote a Cauſe. For the words <hi>continue</hi> he juſtifies <hi>ſcribi fecit.</hi> And that is no juſtification to contrive, which is a word well known, and apt to ſignifie the framing or inventing of Articles, &amp;c.

                  <p>Firſt, it muſt appear plainly that the Plaintiff was a Iuſtice of Peace at the time of the ſpeaking of the words. and implication will not ſerve. I agree that neceſſary intendment ſhall be ſufficient: And if there might be other intendment, it is not ſufficient 13 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 304. <hi>Mich.</hi> 20 <hi>Jac. Kings Bench. Arundel</hi> Plaintiff, <hi>Mead</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> Defendants in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione firmae</hi> brought upon a Leaſe made for 5 years, if a Woman ſhould ſo long live. And after verdict for the Plaintiff. It was moved that the Declaration is not good. Becauſe that it was not averred that the Woman was living at the time of the Ejectment. But it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged that the words <hi>virtute cujus</hi> he was poſſeſſed, and <hi>termino non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam finito,</hi> he was ejected ſupplies that; <hi>Dyer</hi> 254. Debt upon a Leaſe for years rendring rent, the Plaintiff declars upon the leaſe by him made to <hi>A.</hi> who deviſes it to the Defendant and he enters. And it was objected that the Declaration was naught, becauſe that he does not ſhew the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Executors, and it is not ſaid <hi>virtute Legationum,</hi> &amp;c. But that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49570:101"/> he entred and that may be by any other Title, and for that naught. And in our Caſe that he was a Iuſtice of Peace many years before, and at the time of the ſpeaking. And the words <hi>premiſor. non ignorant.</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant intending to remove him, &amp;c. does not aid it. For it might be meant when he was not a Iuſtice of Peace: It is not but by argument that he was then a Iuſtice of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſecond Objection. The ſecond words are not laid to be ſpoken of <hi>Roberti Hitcham</hi> aforeſaid. It is to be obſerved that the words, <hi>And he did then, &amp;c.</hi> be diſtinguiſhed in time. For it is <hi>poſtea ad tunc et ibidem.</hi> By which it ought to be meant ſpoken at another time of the ſame day, and then all the ſubſequent words not actionable. And it is not ſufficient (as it was objected) that he was a Iuſtice of Peace, when the Injuries were ſuppoſed to be done. There are two reaſons why a Iuſtice of Peace ſhall have his Action for words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That if the words be true, they expoſe him to puniſhment or pain, and either of them is ſufficient cauſe to make the words action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And when the words are ſuch, that they do not expoſe the party to puniſhment, but only diſcredit him in his profeſsion, and make him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be removed, they are not actionable unleſs ſpoken at the time that he is a Iuſtice of Peace, And here the words are of ſuch nature. But words which expoſe him to puniſhment for a misdemeanour when he was a Iuſtice of Peace are actionable, although ſpoken after he was removed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Declaration was defective in ſubſtance, for want of a preciſe, ſhewing, that he was a Iuſtice of Peace at the time; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Bar will help it. But defect in circumſtance may be ſo aided <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> by the Bar, as time or place failing in the Bar may be ſupplied by the Bar. 6 <hi>E.</hi> 4.16.6 <hi>E.</hi> 4.2.7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 24. <hi>Buts Caſe, Mi.</hi> 37.38 <hi>Eliz. Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cop</hi> againſt <hi>Atkins, Thy Father hath ſtollen ſix ſheep.</hi> It was moved in arreſt of Iudgement: Becauſe it was not ſhewn in the Declaration that the words were ſpoken to the Son, or in his preſence of his Father the Plaintiff. And as to that it ought to be intended. For it is not ſenſe to ſay <hi>thy Father</hi> to any but the Son. Secondly the Defendant admitted it in his Bar. But reſolved by the whole Court it is not neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that they were ſpoken to the Son. And then it was agréed by all, that the Declaration was defective in ſubſtance, and is not aided by any admittance in the Bar.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third Exception here is, there wants an <hi>Innuendo</hi> to make the Declaration good, where the place is neceſſary to make the words actionable. there ought to be an <hi>Innuendo</hi> for the place, &amp;c. <hi>Barham did burn by Barn,</hi> there no <hi>Innuendo</hi> will make the words actionable. But if there be a Communication of the Plaintiffs Barn, and that it was full of Corn; there with an <hi>Innuendo horreum praedict.</hi> will ſerve. <hi>H.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz. Banc. Roy rot.</hi> 334. Thou art a Thief, thou haſt ſtollen half an acre of my Corn, <hi>Innuendo</hi> half an acre of Corn ſevered. Adjudged that the <hi>Innuendo</hi> does not ſerve. So for Slander of title, Entties <hi>fol.</hi> 36. <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>S.</hi> and there was a Communication of that Mannor of <hi>S.</hi> And the Defendant ſaid <hi>I have enough in my Study to make I. S. Heir to the Mannor of I. S. Innuendo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. praedict de S.</hi> It is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words are not actionable. <hi>Witneſſe, Iudge</hi> and <hi>party</hi> is not a ſcandal without a violent conſtruction of the words. To ſay, he did oppreſſe me. That of a Iuſtice of Peace, without more, is hard to maintain an action; for it does not appear that he was damnified. And words of themſelves which are actionable, joyned with others are not ſometimes actionable. If one ſays of a Lawyer, he did reveal the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of my Caſe; that is not actionable, for he might reveal it to a Iudge: But if he ſaid, Goe not to ſuch a one, he did reveal the ſecrets
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49570:101"/> of my caſe, that is actionable. <hi>Suegos</hi> caſe in the book of Entries. If one ſaid of a Chirurgion, he did poyſon the wound of his patient. That is not actionable, for it might be for the cure of it. But if he ſaid, as it was in 33 and 34 <hi>Eliz. Com. Banc.</hi> He did poyſon the wound of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to get money; That is actionable. And the words here are allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they be joyned with the firſt; For being ſpoken of a Iuſtice, his power and greatneſs may oppreſſe him, without fault in the Plaintiff. One ſaid <hi>M.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of a Iuſtice of Peace, <hi>That he was a Bloodſucker, and thirſteth after blood; yet if you'll give him a couple of Capons he'll take them,</hi> Not actionable, for they are too general. As to the Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, all is juſtified clearly. It was objected <hi>(then)</hi> is omitted in our juſtification. It is true if he complain of oppreſsion one time, and we juſtifie at another time, it ſhall be inſufficient. But the matters of Iuſtification here well enough meet with the time, By which, &amp;c.</p>
